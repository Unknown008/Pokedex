#001	The stench may cause the target to flinch.	Has a 10% chance of making target Pokémon flinch with each hit.  The percentage chance of flinching does not stack with other chances of flinching.  Stench reduces the chances of wild Pokémon encounter in the overworld if the user is in the lead by 50%.
#002	The Pokémon makes it rain if it appears in battle.	Summons rain that lasts indefinitely upon entering battle unless replaced by a different weather condition.  When multiple abilities that change weather upon entering battle activate, the last one to activate will override the weather change.
#003	Its Speed stat is gradually boosted.	Raises the Speed of the user by one stage at the end of each turn.
#004	The Pokémon is protected against critical hits.	Moves cannot land Critical Hits on the user.
#005	It cannot be knocked out with one hit.	One hit KO moves have no effect at all on the user.  If the user is at full HP and is hit by a move which causes 100% HP damage, the user will sustain the damage and have 1 HP left instead of fainting.
#006	Prevents the use of self-destructing moves.	Prevents [move Selfdestruct], [move Explosion] and [ability Aftermath] from working while the user is in battle.
#007	The Pokémon is protected from paralysis.	The user cannot be inflicted with Paralysis.  If the user acquired the ability while paralyzed (including regaining a lost ability through switch out), it will immediately be cured.
#008	Boosts the Pokémon's evasion in a sandstorm.	Increases the evasion of the user by 25% during a sandstorm.  It also protects the user against sandstorm damage if the user does not have the Ground, Steel or Rock typing.  It also lowers the encounter rate in an area by 50% with sandstorm if the user is in the lead.
#009	Contact with the Pokémon may cause paralysis.	An attacking Pokémon has a 30% chance of getting paralyzed on contact.  It also boosts the encounter rate of wild Electric-type Pokémon in the area to 50% if the user is in the lead.
#010	Restores HP if hit by an Electric-type move.	The user absorbs Electric moves, healing for 25% of the user's max HP. Any secondary effects of the Electric move is ignored.  A Ground-type Pokémon will not heal any HP.  It activates behind [move Substitute] but not behind [move Protect].  [ability "Lightning Rod"] has priority over Volt Absorb.
#011	Restores HP if hit by a Water-type move.	The user absorbs Water-type moves, healing for 25% of the user's max HP. Any secondary effects of the Water-type move is ignored.  It activates behind [move Substitute] but not behind [move Protect].  [ability "Storm Drain"] has priority over Water Absorb.
#012	Prevents it from becoming infatuated.	Prevents the user from getting infatuated and protects against [move Captivate].
#013	Eliminates the effects of weather.	Negates all effects of weather, but does not prevent the weather itself.
#014	The Pokémon's accuracy is boosted.	Increases the user's moves' accuracy by 30%.  Compoundeyes also makes it more likely to encounter a Pokémon with a held item in the overworld if the user is in the lead (even if the user has fainted) from 50%/5%/1% to 60%/20%/5%.
#015	Prevents the Pokémon from falling asleep.	The user cannot be inflicted with Sleep.  The user cannot use the [move Rest]. If the user acquired the ability while asleep (including regaining a lost ability through switch out), it will immediately wake up.
#016	Changes the Pokémon's type to the foe's move.	The user's type will change to the type of the last damaging move that hit it.  If the move is a damaging move, it activates on the last hit.  This ability does not activate through [move Substitute] or moves that cause indirect damage.  Any status affliction is applied before Color Change activates.  Color Change activates on the turn [move Future Sight] is used instead of on the turn the user gets hit.  Moves that are affected by [ability Sheer Force] will not activate this ability.
#017	Prevents the Pokémon from getting poisoned.	The user cannot be inflicted with Poison or Toxic Poison.  If the user acquired the ability while poisoned (including regaining a lost ability through switch out), it will immediately be cured.
#018	It powers up Fire-type moves if it's hit by one.	Protects the user against Fire-type moves. Once one has been blocked, the Pokémon's own Fire-type moves inflict 1.5× damage until it leaves battle.  This ability is not activated when the user is inflicted with a Burn status.  The boost caused by Flash Fire is lost if the ability is taken away from the user or disabled and will not be restored if the ability is given back.  The ability activates through [move Substitute].
#019	Blocks the added effects of attacks taken.	Protects the user against incoming moves' extra effects on the user, including additional effects from held items.

In addition, the item [item "Red Card"] will also fail to work.  In the overworld, when the user is in the lead, it will make fishing encounter more likely.
#022	Lowers the foe's Attack stat.	Lowers opponents' Attack one stage upon entering battle.  In triple battles, it will affect only adjacent opponents.  This ability is also activated if the user receives this ability, unless the user has previously lost the ability through [move "Skill Swap"] and regained it through the same way.  This ability does not work through [move Substitute].  In the overworld, if the user is in the lead, chances of encountering Pokémon of 5 levels lower than the user is decreased by 50%.
#023	Prevents the foe from escaping.	As long as the user is on the field, opponents cannot switch out.  [ability "Run Away"] and the use of items and moves that cause switches will however still allow opponents to switch out.  Pokémon that have this ability are immune to it.
#024	Inflicts damage to the foe on contact.	Each time an opponent hits the user with a contact move, they receive 12.5% of their max HP as damage.  If Rough Skin causes both Pokémon to faint, the attacker will faint first.
#025	Only supereffective moves will hit.	The user is immune to direct damage moves that are not super effective.  Wonder Guard does not block typeless moves such as [move Struggle], [move "Beat Up"], [move "Future Sight"] and [move "Doom Desire"].  Wonder Guard cannot be [move "Skill Swap"]ped or copied by [move "Role Play"], but it can be [ability "Trace"]d.  [move "Worry Seed"], [move "Gastro Acid"], [move "Entrainment"] and [move "Simple Beam"] can suppress Wonder Guard.  [move "Entrainment"] can pass Wander Guard to a target.  Wonder Guard works normally on a [move Substitute] created by the user.
#026	Gives full immunity to all Ground-type moves.	The user is immune to Ground-type moves, [move Spikes], [move "Toxic Spikes"] and [ability "Arena Trap"] except [move "Sand Attack"].  It is disabled when using [move Ingrain] or [move Gravity] or when the user is holding [item "Iron Ball"].  It is not disabled when using [move Roost].
#027	Contact may poison or cause paralysis or sleep.	Has a 30% chance of inflicting either paralysis, poison, or sleep on attacking Pokémon on contact (9% to inflict poison, 10% to inflict paralysis and 11% to inflict sleep).
#028	Passes a burn, poison, or paralysis to the foe.	Copies burns, paralysis, poison and bad poison received onto the Pokémon that inflicted them.  Bad poison is copied on as regular poison. Status ailments not received from another Pokémon (e.g. [move "Toxic Spikes"], [move Rest] or [item "Flame Orb"]) are not copied.  An opponent inflicted with a status ailment targeting the user will not be affected by Synchronize.  Wild Pokémon encountered and Pokémon interacted with (excluding roaming Pokémon) have a 50% chance to have the same nature as the user if the user of this ability is in the lead. 
#029	Prevents other Pokémon from lowering its stats.	The opponent cannot lower the user's stats by using a move that specifically lower the stats of the target.
#030	All status problems heal when it switches out.	Cures major status ailments of the user when they switch out.  Activates normally even if the ability is a temporary ability.
#031	Draws in all Electric-type moves to up Sp. Attack.	Redirects single-target Electric-type moves to the user where possible, will not miss, will negate all effects of those moves and will raise the Special Attack of the user if the user is not protected from the move (e.g. by having Earth-typing or is immune to [move "Thunder Wave"], unless holding [item "Ring Target"]).  The effect of [move "Follow Me"] has priority over the effect of Lightning Rod.  The ability has priority over [item "Cell Battery"].  When multiple targets with Lightning Rod are possible, the move will be redirect to the one with the highest speed.  In Triple Battles, the ability does not activate if the user is out of range of the attacker.
#032	Boosts the likelihood of added effects appearing.	Doubles the chance of the user's move's secondary effect (can be from items as well e.g. [item "King's Rock"]) to activate, including stat changes, status ailments and flinching rates.
#033	Boosts the Pokémon's Speed in rain.	Doubles the speed of the user during rain.  This stat boost is not counted as a stat modifier.

#036	The Pokémon copies a foe's Ability.	Copies the ability of a random opponent upon entering battle on the user except [ability Forecast], [ability Trace], [ability Multitype], [ability "Flower Gift"] and [ability "Wonder Guard"]. If Trace failed, it will activate when next exposed to an opponent with a Trace-able ability.

#041	Prevents the Pokémon from getting a burn.	The user cannot be inflicted with Burn.  If the user acquired the ability while burned (including regaining a lost ability through switch out), it will immediately be cured.
#042	Prevents Steel-type Pokémon from escaping.	As long as the user is on the field, Steel-type opponents cannot switch out.  [ability "Run Away"] and the use of items and moves that cause switches will however still allow opponents to switch out.  It also boosts the encounter rate of wild Steel-type Pokémon in the area to 50% if the user is in the lead.
#043	Gives full immunity to all sound-based moves.	The user is immune to sound-based moves except [move "Heal Bell"].  The effect of [move "Uproar"] prevents the user from sleeping.  The user can still obtain a [move "Perish Song"] counter indirectly (e.g. from [move "Baton Pass"]) and will retain the counter if it obtains Soundproof after being affected by [move "Perish Song"].
#044	The Pokémon gradually regains HP in rain.	The user recovers 6.25% of its max HP after each turn there is heavy rain.
#045	The Pokémon summons a sandstorm in battle.	Summons sandstorm that lasts indefinitely upon entering battle unless replaced by a different weather condition.  When multiple abilities that change weather upon entering battle activate, the last one to activate will override the weather change.  It also halves the encounter rate of Pokémon in the area if the user is in the lead and there is a sandstorm.
#046	The Pokémon raises the foe's PP usage.	Causes an opponent which targets the user to use up one extra PP if possible, even if the move misses or fails.  The effect of Pressure stacks if there are allies with the same ability and a multi-target move is used.  Pressure affects an ally if the ally uses a move that single targets the user or the entire field.  It also boosts the encounter rate of higher level Pokémon in the area by 50% if the user is in the lead.
#047	Ups resistance to Fire-​ and Ice-type moves.	Halves the damage received from Fire and Ice-type moves to the user.
#048	The Pokémon awakens quickly from sleep.	Reduces the number of turns the user remains asleep by 2 each turn. If the sleep counter is at 1, the user will wake up at the end of the turn it fell asleep.
#049	Contact with the Pokémon may burn the attacker.	An attacking Pokémon has a 30% chance of getting burned on contact.  Halves the number of steps required to hatch an egg if the user is in the party.
#050	Enables a sure getaway from wild Pokémon.	The user is able to switch out from battles even if trapped.
#051	Prevents other Pokémon from lowering accuracy.	The user cannot have its accuracy lowered.  Keen Eye does not prevent any accuracy losses other than stat modifiers.  Negative accuracy modifiers can still be passed through [move Heart Swap].  In the overworld, if the user is in the lead, chances of encountering Pokémon of 5 levels lower than the user is decreased by 50%.
#052	Prevents other Pokémon from lowering Attack stat.	The user cannot have its attack lowered by other Pokémon. The ability does not prevent Attack loss other than stat modifiers such as the Attack cut from a burn. The user can still be passed negative Attack modifiers through [move "Heart Swap"] or [move "Power Swap"].
#053	The Pokémon may pick up items.	At the end of a turn where another Pokémon consumed or used a one-time use item (including [move Fling] and [move "Natural Gift"]), the user picks up said item if it is not already holding one (except [item "Air Balloon"] and [item "Eject Button"]).  If more than one Pokémon has Pickup or [ability Harvest], the faster Pokémon will restore an item first. If multiple items can be collected, the user can only collect the last item consumed. Pickup cannot activate more than once per turn per user.  The ability cannot collect an item if the Pokémon that consumed the item is no longer on the field at the end of the turn, or if the item has already been recovered (e.g. through [move Recycle], [ability Harvest] or Pickup). Pickup cannot collect an item that a Pokémon consumed before switching out, even if it switched back in again before the end of the turn. Pickup cannot collect items that have been destroyed with [move Incinerate], [move "Bug bite"] or [move Pluck], or removed using [move "Knock Off"].  The user may hold certain items after battle if it is not holding any. The chances of the ability's successful activation and the possible items found depends on the user's level.
#054	Pokémon can't attack on consecutive turns.	The user will loaf around on every second turn it attempts to use a move.  Multi-turn moves (e.g. [move Bide] or [move Rollout]) are interrupted, moves requiring recharge (e.g. [move "Hyper Beam"]) do not have recharge (but the user cannot be switched out on that turn), moves that require charging (e.g. [move Solarbeam] or [move Fly]) will not end up being used, moves that are forced over multiple turns even through failure (e.g. [move Outrage] and [move Uproar] or moves locked with [move Encore]) will keep going as usual).  Confusion check turns are skipped the turn the user loafs around. If the user attempts to move but fails, it still counts as moving and will loaf around the next turn. If it does not attempt to move (e.g. through sleep or frozen), the next action will be resumed once cured.  The ability cannot be suppressed with [move "Worry Seed"], [move Entrainment] or [move "Simple Beam"], but can with [move "Gastro Acid"] or changed with [move "Role Play"] or [move "Skill Swap"].
#055	Boosts the Attack stat, but lowers accuracy.	The user's attack is increased by 50% but the accuracy of its physical moves is lowered by 20%. Physical moves with fixed damage have their accuracy reduced, but the damage remains unchanged.  It also boosts the encounter rate of higher level Pokémon in the area by 50% if the user is in the lead.
#056	Contact with the Pokémon may cause infatuation.	An attacking Pokémon has a 30% chance of getting infatuated on contact.  If the user is in the lead, chances of encountering a Pokémon of opposite gender is increased to 66%. This has no effect on genderless or swarming Pokémon or Pokémon found in Hidden Grotto.
#057	Ups Sp. Atk if another Pokémon has Plus or Minus.	Raises the Special Attack of the user if any ally has [ability Minus] or [ability Plus]. The bonus does not count as a stat modifier and will be removed if either ability is removed.
#058	Ups Sp. Atk if another Pokémon has Plus or Minus.	Raises the Special Attack of the user if any ally has [ability Minus] or [ability Plus]. The bonus does not count as a stat modifier and will be removed if either ability is removed.
#059	Castform transforms with the weather.	Changes the user's type and form according to the weather if it is a Castform, except during Sandstorm.  If the weather conditions change to something that does not trigger the ability, the user will revert to normal form.  If the ability is lost or suppressed, the user will revert to its original form until the ability is restored.
#060	Protects the Pokémon from item theft.	Prevents an opponent from removing a held item from the user using moves like [move Covet], [move Thief], [move "Knock Off"], [move "Bug Bite"], [move Switcheroo], unless the opponent has [ability "Mold Breaker"], [ability Turboblaze] or [ability Teravolt].  The user can still use moves that involves the loss of its own item (e.g. [move Trick], [move Fling], [move Switcheroo]).  It also makes Pokémon easier to get hooked when fishing if the user is in the lead.
#061	The Pokémon may heal its own status problems.	The user has a 33% chance of getting healed from any major status ailment after each turn, before the status activates in case the status is Burn or Poison.
#062	Boosts Attack if there is a status problem.	Increases the user's Attack by 50% when it has a major status ailment, and ignores the attack cut associated with Burn.  The boost is not counted as a stat boost.
#063	Ups Defense if there is a status problem.	Increases the user's Defense by 50% when it has a major status ailment.  The boost is not counted as a stat boost.
#064	Damages attackers using any draining move.	The opponent loses the amount of HP it would have gained when using a leeching move on the user, including [move Absorb], [move "Mega Drain"], [move "Giga Drain"], [move "Leech Life"] and [move "Leech Seed"]. Liquid Ooze does not affect [move "Dream Eater"]. 
#065	Powers up Grass-type moves in a pinch.	The user's Grass-type moves inflict 50% more damage when the user's HP drops to 33% or lower of its max HP.
#066	Powers up Fire-type moves in a pinch.	The user's Fire-type moves inflict 50% more damage when the user's HP drops to 33% or lower of its max HP.
#067	Powers up Water-type moves in a pinch.	The user's Water-type moves inflict 50% more damage when the user's HP drops to 33% or lower of its max HP.
#068	Powers up Bug-type moves in a pinch.	The user's Bug-type moves inflict 50% more damage when the user's HP drops to 33% or lower of its max HP.
#069	Protects the Pokémon from recoil damage.	The user will not receive recoil damage from the moves it uses. Crash damage from [move "Jump Kick"] and [move "Hi Jump Kick"] still occurs. The recoil from [move Struggle] still occurs.  The recoil received from using [item Life Orb], [item "Jaboca Berry"] and [item "Rowap Berry"] still occurs.
#070	Turns the sunlight harsh if it is in battle.	Summons harsh sunlight that lasts indefinitely upon entering battle unless replaced by a different weather condition.  When multiple abilities that change weather upon entering battle activate, the last one to activate will override the weather change.
#071	Prevents the foe from fleeing.	Prevents an opponent from switching out or escaping (including via [move Teleport]).  Opponents immune to Ground-type moves are immune to the ability (e.g. Flying-type Pokémon, though [ability Levitate], [move "Magnet Rise"], [move Telekinesis], [item "Air Balloon"]). If a normally immune opponent is made vulnerable to Ground-type moves (e.g. through change of typing, suppression or change in ability, holding [item "Iron Ball"], affected by [move Gravity] or [move "Smack Down"]), the opponent will be affected by Arena Trap. [move U-Turn], [move "Volt Switch"], [move "Baton Pass"] still allows an opponent to switch out. Holding [item "Shed Shell"] allows an opponent to switch out, but not escape or [move Teleport]. Having [ability "Run Away"] or holding [item "Smoke Ball"] allows escaping but not switching out.  It also doubles the encounter rate of Pokémon in the overworld.
#072	Prevents the Pokémon from falling asleep.	The user cannot be inflicted with Sleep.  The user cannot use the [move Rest]. If the user acquired the ability while asleep (including regaining a lost ability through switch out), it will immediately wake up.  It also boosts the encounter rate of higher level Pokémon in the area by 50% if the user is in the lead.
#073	Prevents other Pokémon from lowering its stats.	The opponent cannot lower the user's stats by using a move that specifically lower the stats of the target.
#074	Raises the Pokémon's Attack stat.	Doubles the attack of the user when in battle.  This stat boost is not counted as a stat modifier.
#075	The Pokémon is protected against critical hits.	Moves cannot land Critical Hits on the user.
#076	Eliminates the effects of weather.	Negates all effects of weather, but does not prevent the weather itself.
#077	Raises evasion if the Pokémon is confused.	Increases evasion of the user by 20% when confused. The boost ends when confusion ends
#078	Raises Speed if hit by an Electric-type move.	Protects the user from Electric-type moves, will not miss, will negate all effects of those moves and will raise the Speed of the user by 50% if the user is not protected from the move (e.g. by having Earth-typing). The ability has priority over [item "Cell Battery"] and activates through [move Substitute].
#079	Deals more damage to a Pokémon of same gender.	Increases damage inflicted by the user against opponents of the same gender by 25%, but decreases damage against the opposite gender by 25%.  The ability has no effect if either Pokémon are genderless.
#080	Raises Speed each time the Pokémon flinches.	The user's Speed is raised by 50% upon flinching.  Flinching caused when using [move "Focus Punch"] and failing to do so does not activate this ability.
#081	Raises evasion in a hailstorm.	Increases the evasion of the user by 25% during a hail.  It also protects the user against hail damage if the user does not have the Ice typing.  It also lowers the encounter rate in an area by 50% with blizzard if the user is in the lead.
#082	Encourages the early use of a held Berry.	Causes the user to eat any held berry triggered by low HP when it falls to or below 50% of its HP, ignoring the usual threshold.
#083	Maxes Attack after taking a critical hit.	Raises the Attack of the user to 6 stages (4 times its original Attack) when the user is hit with a critical hit.
#084	Raises Speed if a held item is used.	Doubles the speed of the user when it uses or loses its held item. If the user gains an item or leaves the battle, the boost is lost.  The bonus does not count as a stat modifier.
#085	Weakens the power of Fire-type moves.	Halves damage the user receives from Fire moves and burns.
#086	The Pokémon is prone to wild stat changes.	Doubles the user's stat modifiers. These doubled modifiers are still capped at -6 or 6 stages.
#087	Reduces HP if it is hot. Water restores HP.	The user takes 12.5% of its max HP as damage each turn during strong sunlight, but heals for 12.5% of its max HP during rain. Increases damage received from Fire-type moves by 25%, but absorbs Water-type moves, healing for 25% of the  HP.  The ability has priority over held items and works through [move Substitute].
#088	Adjusts power according to a foe's defenses.	Raises the user's attack stat corresponding to the opponents' weaker defense by 1 stage upon entering battle. In case the Defense and Special Defense stats tie, the Special Attack of the user is boosted instead.  In multi battles, the sum of the opponents' Defense and Special Defense determine the boosted attack.  the ability activates when acquired and boosts from the ability are lost when the ability is lost or suppressed.
#089	Boosts the power of punching moves.	The user's punch-based moves get a 20% boost in base power.  Punch-based moves include [move "Hammer Arm"], [move "Meteor Mash"] and [move "Sky Uppercut"] besides the moves with 'Punch' in their names, but excludes [move "Sucker Punch"].
#090	Restores HP if the Pokémon is poisoned.	The user recovers 12.5% of its max HP after each turn when poisoned or badly poisoned in place of taking damage.  If the user is badly poisoned, the toxic counters still continue, meaning that if the ability is lost or suppressed, the user will take the damage normally taken after the number of turns spent under toxic.  The user still takes poison damage outside of battle.
#091	Powers up moves of the same type.	Boosts the same-type attack bonus of the user from 1.5× to 2×.
#092	Increases the frequency of multi-strike moves.	The user's multi-hit moves always hit the maximum number of times.  [move "Triple Kick"]'s accuracy checks for the second and third hit are bypassed.  If the ability is lost or suppressed in the middle of hits (e.g. through [ability Mummy], the attack used still hits for the maximum number of times.
#093	Heals status problems if it is raining.	The user is cured of any major status ailment after each turn during rain.
#094	In sunshine, Sp. Atk is boosted but HP decreases.	Increases the user's Special Attack by 50% but the user loses 12.5% of its max HP after each turn during strong sunlight.
#095	Boosts Speed if there is a status problem.	Increases the user's Speed by 50% with when it has a major status ailment, and ignores the cut in Speed caused by Paralysis.  It also reduces the encounter rate of Pokémon in the area by 50% if the user is in the lead.
#096	All the Pokémon's moves become the Normal type.	Makes the user's moves all act Normal-type; being not very effective on Rock and Steel-types and ineffective on Ghost-types. Typeless moves remain typeless. [move "Weather Ball"] is forced to be normal type but still changes appearance and power under appropriate weather. [move "Will-O-Wisp"] for example will not activate [ability "Flash Fire"] and will not burn Fire-types since they are immune to burn.
#097	Powers up moves if they become critical hits.	The user's critical hits deal 50% more damage than usual.
#098	The Pokémon only takes damage from attacks.	The user is immune to indirect damage (status ailments, field hazards, weather, recoil); other effects like Atk cut from Burn still apply. [move "Leech Seed"] and [ability "Liquid Ooze"] will damage/heal neither the user nor the opponent. An opponent will not consume their [item "Jaboca Berry"] or [item "Rowap Berry"] when hit by the user. Self-inflicted damage such as [move "Belly Drum"], [move "Pain Split"], [move Curse], [move Substitute] and [move Struggle], self knockout moves and confusion damage still apply. Turn counters on bad poison still continue despite the damage being negated.
#099	Ensures attacks by or against the Pokémon land.	Moves used by or against the user never miss (except OHKO moves), even if the target is using [move Dig], [move Fly], [move Bounce], [move Dive] or [move "Shadow Force"].  Doubles the chances of wild Pokémon encounter in the overworld if the user is in the lead.
#100	The Pokémon moves after all other Pokémon do.	The user will move last within the same move priority order. If there are multiple users of Stall, their speed determines the order of their moves.  The effects of [item "Full Incense"] and [item "Lagging Tail"] have priority over the ability, meaning the holder of such items will move after the user. If the user is holding either items, the ability is ignored.  The ability still makes the user move last during [move "Trick Room"].
#101	Powers up the Pokémon's weaker moves.	The user's moves with final base power of 60 or less have their base power raised by 50%, including [move Struggle].  Self inflicted damage due to confusion which has a base power of 40 does not get boosted.
#102	Prevents problems with status in sunny weather.	The user cannot be inflicted with major status ailments during strong sunlight.  The ability does not heal those inflicted before the required conditions are in place for the ability to activate.  [move Yawn] and [move Rest] will fail to activate. An already-used [move Yawn] will fail if the required conditions are subsequently met on the turn [move Yawn] takes effect.
#103	The Pokémon can't use any held items.	Items the user holds are completely ignored. The user cannot use [move Fling].  Items that do not affect the course of battles work (e.g. [item "Exp. Share"], [item "Amulet Coin"], [item "Soothe Bell"]).  Other moves that use held items such as [move "Natural Gift"] and [move Switcheroo] work as usual.
#104	Moves can be used regardless of Abilities.	The user's moves ignore the target's abilities that would otherwise hinder or prevent their current effect on the target, or their resolving moves (e.g. [move Spike]).
#105	Heightens the critical- hit ratios of moves.	The user has its moves' critical hit rates raised by one stage.
#106	Damages the attacker landing the finishing hit.	Damages the attacker for 25% its max HP when the user is knocked out by a contact move.
#107	Senses a foe's dangerous moves.	Notifies all trainers upon entering battle if an opponent has a super-effective move, Self-Destruct, Explosion, or a one-hit KO move. The move itself is not revealed. [move Counter], [move "Mirror Coat"] and [move "Metal Burst"] count as attacking moves of their respective types, while [move Bide], [move "Hidden Power"], [move Judgement], [move "Natural Gift"], [move "Techno Blast"] and [move "Weather Ball"] are considered to be Normal-type.

If the user attacks, the Defense, Special Defense and Evasion stat changes of the target are ignored.

#111	Reduces damage from supereffective attacks.	Decreases damage received from super effective moves by 25%.

The user takes the name, gender, appearance, Pokeball, form if any and shininess if any of the last  Pokémon in the trainer's party upon being sent out, until hit by a damaging move, or the ability is negated or removed. If the user is hit by a multi-strike move, the user takes its original appearance after the first hit.  All calculations are based on the user's original identity (e.g. calculations or effects that depend on gender and weight).  [move "Role Play"] will fail on the user, [move "Skill Swap"] will fail if any or the user or the target has the ability, [ability Trace] does not copy the ability, and if a Pokémon obtains the ability through [move Transform] or [ability Illusion], it will not disguise itself.  Illusion does not work if the target of the Illusion is of the same species as the user or if the target has fainted.
#150	It transforms itself into the Pokémon it is facing.	The user transforms when it is sent out, mimicking the move [move Transform] in all respects. The ability will not activate if the opponent is transformed, disguised with [ability Illusion] or behind a [move Substitute]. In multibattles, the user will transform into the opponent directly opposite, or if there are none, the ability will fail to activate.  [move "Role Play"] fails if the target has the ability, [move Entrainment] fails if the user has the ability, [ability Trace] cannot copy the ability.
#151	Passes through the foe's barrier and strikes.	The user will ignore the effects of a target's [move Reflect], [move "Light Screen"], [move Safeguard] and [move Mist].
#152	Contact with this Pokémon spreads this Ability.	When the user is hit by a contact move, the attacker's ability will change to Mummy. If the user is hit by a multi-strike move, the attacker will have its ability changed after the first strike.  If the attacker with [ability "Rock Head"] attacks the user with a recoil move, its ability will change to Mummy before recoil damage is inflicted, thus causing the attacker to take recoil damage.  The ability cannot be copied on Pokémon having the ability [ability Multitype].
#153	Boosts Attack after knocking out any Pokémon.	Raises the user's Attack by one stage upon knocking out a Pokémon.  If the user knocks out a Pokémon with [ability Mummy], it loses its ability before the Attack is boosted.
#154	Raises Attack when hit by a Dark-type move.	Raises the user's Attack by one stage upon being hit by a Dark-type move.  If the user is hit with a multi-hit move, each hit activates the ability.
#155	Some move types scare it and boost its Speed.	Raises the user's Speed by one stage upon being hit by a Dark-type, Ghost-type, or Bug-type move.  If the user is hit with a multi-hit move, each hit activates the ability.
#156	Reflects status- changing moves.	Reflects the effect of status moves (excluding [move Memento]) that target the user back at the attacker. These moves can still miss.  The ability does not activate if the user is immune against the move being used due to its type or species (e.g. a Ground-type Pokémon being targeted by [move "Thunder Wave"] or Dugtrio being targeted by [move Telekinesis]) or if the user is protected from the move. It can reflect a move even if the move would fail (e.g. [move Disable] used on a Pokémon that has not used a move or is already disabled) or have no effect on the target (e.g. [move "Feather Dance"] when the target already has -6 Attack).  If a move targets multiple Pokémon individually (such as [move "Heal Block"] or [move Growl]), it will still affect each Pokémon that does not have Magic Bounce normally, then each Pokémon that has Magic Bounce will reflect the move individually. If a move targets the entire ally field (such as entry hazard moves), Magic Bounce will reflect the move completely (if multiple allies have Magic Bounce, only one will activate).  Does not activate if the move is used by a Pokémon with [ability Teravolt], [ability Turboblaze], or [ability "Mold Breaker"].  Only activates once per turn.  Magic Bounce cannot reflect a move that was just reflected by [move "Magic Coat"] or Magic Bounce. Does not activate if the user is in off the field (e.g. using [move Fly]).
#157	Boosts Attack when hit by a Grass-type move.	Grass-type moves targetting the user are negated and raise its Attack by one stage (except Aromatherapy). Multi-strike moves, such as [move "Bullet Seed"] will activate the raise in Attack stat only once per move.  The ability does not activate if the user is protected from the move.
#158	Gives priority to a status move.	Raises the priority of the user's status moves by one.  These moves are not considered priority moves and as such are not blocked using [move "Quick Guard"].
#159	Boosts certain moves' power in a sandstorm.	Raises the user's Rock-type, Ground-type and Steel-type moves by 30% during a sandstorm. Protects the user against sandstorm damage.
#160	Inflicts damage to the Pokémon on contact.	Each time an opponent hits the user with a contact move, they receive 12.5% of their max HP as damage.  If Iron Barbs causes both Pokémon to faint, the attacker will faint first.
#161	Changes the Pokémon's shape when HP is halved.	Changes Darmanitan's form at the start and at the end of each turn depending on its HP: Zen Mode below 50% max HP, and Standard Mode otherwise.  If Darmanitan loses the ability, it will revert to Standard Mode if it is in Zen Mode and be unable to change mode. If Darmanitan acquires the ability, it will change form at the end of the turn depending on its HP at that point.  [move Entrainment] and [ability Trace] fail on the user. 
#162	Boosts the accuracy of its allies and itself.	Increases the move accuracy all allies (including the user) by 10%.
#163	Moves can be used regardless of Abilities.	The user's moves ignore the target's abilities that would otherwise hinder or prevent their current effect on the target, or their resolving moves (e.g. [move Spike]).
#164	Moves can be used regardless of Abilities.	The user's moves ignore the target's abilities that would otherwise hinder or prevent their current effect on the target, or their resolving moves (e.g. [move Spike]).
