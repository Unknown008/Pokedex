#023	Prevents the foe's escape.	As long as the user is on the field, opponents cannot switch out.  [ability "Run Away"] and the use of items and moves that cause switches will however still allow opponents to switch out.

[move "Toxic Spikes"] activates Synchronize only if a Pokémon on the field directly causes the user to switch in (e.g. using [move Roar] or [move Whirlwind]). An opponent inflicted with a status ailment targeting the user will be affected by Synchronize.  Wild Pokémon encountered (excluding roaming and interacted Pokémon) have a 50% chance to have the same nature as the user if the user of this ability is in the lead.

#052	Prevents ATTACK reduction.	The user cannot have its attack lowered by other Pokémon. The ability does not prevent Attack loss other than stat modifiers such as the Attack cut from a burn.  Using cut in the overworld on grassy areas with the user in the party will double the cut grass radius.
#053	May pick up items.	The user may hold certain items after battle if it is not holding any. The chances of the ability's successful activation and the possible items found depends on the user's level.
#054	Moves only every two turns.	The user will loaf around on every second turn it attempts to use a move.  Multi-turn moves (e.g. [move Bide] or [move Rollout]) are interrupted, moves requiring recharge (e.g. [move "Hyper Beam"]) do not have recharge (but the user cannot be switched out on that turn), moves that require charging (e.g. [move Solarbeam] or [move Fly]) will not end up being used, moves that are forced over multiple turns even through failure (e.g. [move Outrage] and [move Uproar] or moves locked with [move Encore]) will keep going as usual).  Confusion check turns are skipped the turn the user loafs around. If the user attempts to move but fails, it still counts as moving and will loaf around the next turn. If it does not attempt to move (e.g. through sleep or frozen), the next action will be resumed once cured. 
#055	Trades accuracy for power.	The user's attack is increased by 50% but the accuracy of its physical moves is lowered by 20%.

#059	Changes with the weather.	Changes the user's type and form according to the weather if it is a Castform, except during Sandstorm.  If the weather conditions change to something that does not trigger the ability, the user will revert to normal form.  If the ability is lost or suppressed, the user will not be able to change type or form until the ability is restored. When restored, the ability activates even if the user has the correct form and type in the current weather conditions.
#060	Prevents item theft.	Prevents an opponent from removing a held item from the user using moves like[move Covet], [move Thief] and [move "Knock Off"].

[move "Baton Pass"] still allows an opponent to switch out. Having [ability "Run Away"] or holding [item "Smoke Ball"] allows escaping but not switching out.
