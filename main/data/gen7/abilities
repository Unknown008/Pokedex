#001	By releasing stench when attacking, this Pokémon may cause the target to flinch.	Has a 10% chance of making target Pokémon flinch with each hit.  The percentage chance of flinching does not stack with other chances of flinching.  Stench reduces the chances of wild Pokémon encounter in the overworld if the user is in the lead by 50%.
#002	The Pokémon makes it rain when it enters a battle.	Summons rain that lasts for 5 turns upon entering battle unless replaced by a different weather condition before then.  When multiple abilities that change weather upon entering battle activate, the last one to activate will override the weather change.  The number of turns the rain remains active can be increased if the user holds a [item "Damp Rock"].
#003	Its Speed stat is boosted every turn.	Raises the Speed of the user by one stage at the end of each turn.
#004	Hard armor protects the Pokémon from critical hits.	Moves cannot land Critical Hits on the user.
#005	It cannot be knocked out with one hit. One-hit KO moves cannot knock it out, either.	One hit KO moves have no effect at all on the user.  If the user is at full HP and is hit by a move which causes 100% HP damage, the user will sustain the damage and have 1 HP left instead of fainting.
#006	Prevents the use of explosive moves such as Self-Destruct by dampening its surroundings.	Prevents [move Selfdestruct], [move Explosion] and [ability Aftermath] from working while the user is in battle.
#007	Its limber body protects the Pokémon from paralysis.	The user cannot be inflicted with Paralysis.  If the user acquired the ability while paralyzed (including regaining a lost ability through switch out), it will immediately be cured.
#008	Boosts the Pokémon’s evasion in a sandstorm.	Increases the evasion of the user by 25% during a sandstorm.  It also protects the user against sandstorm damage if the user does not have the Ground, Steel or Rock typing.  It also lowers the encounter rate in an area by 50% with sandstorm if the user is in the lead.
#009	The Pokémon is charged with static electricity, so contact with it may cause paralysis.	An attacking Pokémon has a 30% chance of getting paralyzed on contact.  It also boosts the encounter rate of wild Electric-type Pokémon in the area to 50% if the user is in the lead.
#010	Restores HP if hit by an Electric-type move, instead of taking damage.	The user absorbs Electric moves, healing for 25% of the user's max HP. Any secondary effects of the Electric move is ignored.  A Ground-type Pokémon will not heal any HP.  It activates behind [move Substitute] but not behind [move Protect].  [ability "Lightning Rod"] has priority over Volt Absorb.
#011	Restores HP if hit by a Water-type move, instead of taking damage.	The user absorbs Water-type moves, healing for 25% of the user's max HP. Any secondary effects of the Water-type move is ignored.  It activates behind [move Substitute] but not behind [move Protect].  [ability "Storm Drain"] has priority over Water Absorb.
#012	The Pokémon is oblivious, and that keeps it from being infatuated or falling for taunts.	Prevents the user from getting infatuated and protects against [move Captivate].
#013	Eliminates the effects of weather.	Negates all effects of weather, but does not prevent the weather itself.
#014	The Pokémon’s compound eyes boost its accuracy.	Increases the user's moves' accuracy by 30%  Compoundeyes also makes it more likely to encounter a Pokémon with a held item in the overworld if the user is in the lead (even if the user has fainted) from 50%/5%/1% to 60%/20%/5%.
#015	The Pokémon is suffering from insomnia and cannot fall asleep.	The user cannot be inflicted with Sleep.  The user cannot use the [move Rest]. If the user acquired the ability while asleep (including regaining a lost ability through switch out), it will immediately wake up.
#016	The Pokémon’s type becomes the type of the move used on it.	The user's type will change to the type of the last damaging move that hit it.  If the move is a damaging move, it activates on the last hit.  This ability does not activate through [move Substitute] or moves that cause indirect damage.  Any status affliction is applied before Color Change activates.  Color Change activates on the turn [move Future Sight] is used instead of on the turn the user gets hit.
#017	The immune system of the Pokémon prevents it from getting poisoned.	The user cannot be inflicted with Poison or Toxic Poison.  If the user acquired the ability while poisoned (including regaining a lost ability through switch out), it will immediately be cured.
#018	Powers up the Pokémon’s Fire-type moves if it’s hit by one.	Protects the user against Fire-type moves. Once one has been blocked, the Pokémon's own Fire-type moves inflict 1.5× damage until it leaves battle.  This ability is not activated when the user is inflicted with a Burn status.  The boost caused by Flash Fire is lost if the ability is taken away from the user or disabled and will not be restored if the ability is given back.  The ability activates through [move Substitute].
#019	This Pokémon’s dust blocks the additional effects of attacks taken.	Protects the user against incoming moves' extra effects on the user, including additional effects from held items.
#020	This Pokémon has its own tempo, and that prevents it from becoming confused.	The user cannot be inflicted with Confusion.  If the user acquires this ability while confused, it will immediately be cured.
#021	This Pokémon uses suction cups to stay in one spot to negate all moves and items that forces witching out.	The user cannot be forced out of battle by other Pokémon's moves such as [move Whirlwind], [move Roar], [move "Circle Throw"] and [move "Dragon Tail"]. In addition, the item [item "Red Card"] will also fail to work.  In the overworld, when the user is in the lead, it will make fishing encounter more likely.
#022	The Pokémon intimidates opposing Pokémon upon entering battle, lowering their Attack stat.	Lowers opponents' Attack one stage upon entering battle.  In triple battles, it will affect only adjacent opponents.  This ability is also activated if the user receives this ability, unless the user has previously lost the ability through [move "Skill Swap"] and regained it through the same way.  This ability does not work through [move Substitute].  In the overworld, if the user is in the lead, chances of encountering Pokémon of 5 levels lower than the user is decreased by 50%.
#023	This Pokémon steps on the opposing Pokémon's shadow to prevent it from escaping.	As long as the user is on the field, opponents cannot switch out.  [ability "Run Away"] and the use of items and moves that cause switches will however still allow opponents to switch out.  Pokémon that have this ability and Ghost-type Pokémon are immune to it.
#024	This Pokémon inflicts damage with its rough skin to the attacker on contact.	Each time an opponent hits the user with a contact move, they receive 12.5% of their max HP as damage.  If Rough Skin causes both Pokémon to faint, the attacker will faint first.
#025	Its mysterious power only lets supereffective moves hit the Pokémon.	The user is immune to direct damage moves that are not super effective.  Wonder Guard does not block typeless moves such as [move Struggle], [move "Beat Up"], [move "Future Sight"] and [move "Doom Desire"].  Wonder Guard cannot be [move "Skill Swap"]ped or copied by [move "Role Play"], but it can be [ability "Trace"]d.  [move "Worry Seed"], [move "Gastro Acid"], [move "Entrainment"] and [move "Simple Beam"] can suppress Wonder Guard.  [move "Entrainment"] can pass Wander Guard to a target.  Wonder Guard works normally on a [move Substitute] created by the user.
#026	By floating in the air, the Pokémon receives full immunity to all Ground-type moves.	The user is immune to Ground-type moves, [move Spikes], [move "Toxic Spikes"] and [ability "Arena Trap"] except [move "Sand Attack"].  It is disabled when using [move Ingrain] or [move Gravity] or when the user is holding [item "Iron Ball"].  It is not disabled when using [move Roost].
#027	Contact with the Pokémon may inflict poison, sleep, or paralysis on its attacker.	Has a 30% chance of inflicting either paralysis, poison, or sleep on attacking Pokémon on contact (9% to inflict poison, 10% to inflict paralysis and 11% to inflict sleep).  Grass-type Pokémon and those with [ability Overcoat] are not affected by Effect Spore.
#028	The attacker will receive the same status condition if it inflicts a burn, poison, or paralysis to the Pokémon.	Copies burns, paralysis, poison and bad poison received onto the Pokémon that inflicted them.  Bad poison is copied on as regular poison. Status ailments not received from another Pokémon (e.g. [move "Toxic Spikes"], [move Rest] or [item "Flame Orb"]) are not copied.  An opponent inflicted with a status ailment targeting the user will not be affected by Synchronize.  Wild Pokémon encountered and Pokémon interacted with (excluding roaming Pokémon) have a 50% chance to have the same nature as the user if the user of this ability is in the lead. 
#029	Prevents other Pokémon’s moves or Abilities from lowering the Pokémon’s stats.	The opponent cannot lower the user's stats by using a move or ability that specifically lower the stats of the target.
#030	All status conditions heal when the Pokémon switches out.	Cures major status ailments of the user when they switch out.  Activates normally even if the ability is a temporary ability.
#031	The Pokémon draws in all Electric-type moves. Instead of being hit by Electric-type moves, it boosts its Sp. Atk.	Redirects single-target Electric-type moves to the user where possible, will not miss, will negate all effects of those moves and will raise the Special Attack of the user if the user is not protected from the move (e.g. by having Earth-typing or is immune to [move "Thunder Wave"], unless holding [item "Ring Target"]).  The effect of [move "Follow Me"] has priority over the effect of Lightning Rod.  The ability has priority over [item "Cell Battery"].  When multiple targets with Lightning Rod are possible, the move will be redirect to the one with the highest speed.  In Triple Battles, the ability does not activate if the user is out of range of the attacker.
#032	Boosts the likelihood of additional effects occurring when attacking.	Doubles the chance of the user's move's secondary effect (can be from items as well e.g. [item "King's Rock"]) to activate, including stat changes, status ailments and flinching rates.
#033	Boosts the Pokémon’s Speed stat in rain.	Doubles the speed of the user during rain.  This stat boost is not counted as a stat modifier.
#034	Boosts the Pokémon’s Speed stat in sunshine.	Doubles the speed of the user during strong sunlight.  This stat boost is not counted as a stat modifier.
#035	Raises the likelihood of meeting wild Pokémon by illuminating the surroundings.	Wild encounter rate is doubled is the user is in the lead.
#036	When it enters a battle, the Pokémon copies an opposing Pokémon’s Ability.	Copies the ability of a random opponent upon entering battle on the user except [ability Forecast], [ability Trace], [ability Multitype], [ability "Flower Gift"], [ability "Wonder Guard"], [ability "Illusion"], [ability Imposter] and [ability "Zen Mode"]. If Trace failed, it will activate when next exposed to an opponent with a Trace-able ability.
#037	Doubles the Pokémon’s Attack stat.	Doubles the attack of the user when in battle.  This stat boost is not counted as a stat modifier.
#038	Contact with the Pokémon may poison the attacker.	Has a 30% chance of inflicting poison on attacking Pokémon on contact.
#039	The Pokémon’s intensely focused, and that protects the Pokémon from flinching.	The user cannot flinch.
#040	The Pokémon is covered with hot magma, which prevents the Pokémon from becoming frozen.	The user cannot be frozen.  The user will thaw out upon acquiring the ability (including recovering it upon switching out).  Halves the number of steps required to hatch an egg if the user is in the party.
#041	The Pokémon is covered with a water veil, which prevents the Pokémon from getting a burn.	The user cannot be inflicted with Burn.  If the user acquired the ability while burned (including regaining a lost ability through switch out), it will immediately be cured.
#042	Prevents Steel-type Pokémon from escaping using its magnetic force.	As long as the user is on the field, Steel-type opponents cannot switch out.  [ability "Run Away"] and the use of items and moves that cause switches will however still allow opponents to switch out.  It also boosts the encounter rate of wild Steel-type Pokémon in the area to 50% if the user is in the lead.  Ghost-type Pokémon are immune to it.
#043	Soundproofing of the Pokémon itself gives full immunity to all sound-based moves.	The user is immune to sound-based moves except [move "Heal Bell"].  The effect of [move "Uproar"] prevents the user from sleeping.  The user can still obtain a [move "Perish Song"] counter indirectly (e.g. from [move "Baton Pass"]) and will retain the counter if it obtains Soundproof after being affected by [move "Perish Song"].
#044	The Pokémon gradually regains HP in rain.	The user recovers 6.25% of its max HP after each turn there is heavy rain.
#045	The Pokémon summons a sandstorm when it enters a battle.	Summons sandstorm that lasts for 5 turns upon entering battle unless replaced by a different weather condition before then.  When multiple abilities that change weather upon entering battle activate, the last one to activate will override the weather change.  The number of turns the harsh sunlight remains active can be increased if the user holds a [item "Smooth Rock"].  It also halves the encounter rate of Pokémon in the area if the user is in the lead and there is a sandstorm.
#046	By putting pressure on the opposing Pokémon, it raises their PP usage.	Causes an opponent which targets the user to use up one extra PP if possible, even if the move misses or fails.  The effect of Pressure stacks if there are allies with the same ability and a multi-target move is used.  Pressure affects an ally if the ally uses a move that single targets the user or the entire field.  It also boosts the encounter rate of higher level Pokémon in the area by 50% if the user is in the lead.
#047	The Pokémon is protected by a layer of thick fat, which halves the damage taken from Fire- and Ice-type moves.	Halves the damage received from Fire and Ice-type moves to the user.
#048	The Pokémon awakens twice as fast as other Pokémon from sleep.	Reduces the number of turns the user remains asleep by 2 each turn. If the sleep counter is at 1, the user will wake up at the end of the turn it fell asleep.
#049	Contact with the Pokémon may burn the attacker.	An attacking Pokémon has a 30% chance of getting burned on contact.  Halves the number of steps required to hatch an egg if the user is in the party.
#050	Enables a sure getaway from wild Pokémon.	The user is able to switch out from battles even if trapped.
#051	Keen eyes prevent other Pokémon from lowering this Pokémon's accuracy.	The user cannot have its accuracy lowered and will ignore evasion boosts from opponents.  Keen Eye does not prevent any accuracy losses other than stat modifiers.  Negative accuracy modifiers can still be passed through [move Heart Swap].  In the overworld, if the user is in the lead, chances of encountering Pokémon of 5 levels lower than the user is decreased by 50%.
#052	The Pokémon’s proud of its powerful pincers. They prevent other Pokémon from lowering its Attack stat.	The user cannot have its attack lowered by other Pokémon. The ability does not prevent Attack loss other than stat modifiers such as the Attack cut from a burn. The user can still be passed negative Attack modifiers through [move "Heart Swap"] or [move "Power Swap"].
#053	The Pokémon may pick up the item an opposing Pokémon used during a battle. It may pick up items outside of battle, too.	At the end of a turn where another Pokémon consumed or used a one-time use item (including [move Fling] and [move "Natural Gift"]), the user picks up said item if it is not already holding one (except [item "Air Balloon"] and [item "Eject Button"]).  If more than one Pokémon has Pickup or [ability Harvest], the faster Pokémon will restore an item first. If multiple items can be collected, the user can only collect the last item consumed. Pickup cannot activate more than once per turn per user.  The ability cannot collect an item if the Pokémon that consumed the item is no longer on the field at the end of the turn, or if the item has already been recovered (e.g. through [move Recycle], [ability Harvest] or Pickup). Pickup cannot collect an item that a Pokémon consumed before switching out, even if it switched back in again before the end of the turn. Pickup cannot collect items that have been destroyed with [move Incinerate], [move "Bug bite"] or [move Pluck], or removed using [move "Knock Off"].  The user may hold certain items after battle if it is not holding any. The chances of the ability's successful activation and the possible items found depends on the user's level.
#054	The Pokémon can’t use a move the following turn if it uses one.	The user will loaf around on every second turn it attempts to use a move.  Multi-turn moves (e.g. [move Bide] or [move Rollout]) are interrupted, moves requiring recharge (e.g. [move "Hyper Beam"]) do not have recharge (but the user cannot be switched out on that turn), moves that require charging (e.g. [move Solarbeam] or [move Fly]) will not end up being used, moves that are forced over multiple turns even through failure (e.g. [move Outrage] and [move Uproar] or moves locked with [move Encore]) will keep going as usual).  Confusion check turns are skipped the turn the user loafs around. If the user attempts to move but fails, it still counts as moving and will loaf around the next turn. If it does not attempt to move (e.g. through sleep or frozen), the next action will be resumed once cured.  The ability cannot be suppressed with [move "Worry Seed"], [move Entrainment] or [move "Simple Beam"], but can with [move "Gastro Acid"] or changed with [move "Role Play"] or [move "Skill Swap"].
#055	Boosts the Attack stat, but lowers accuracy.	The user's attack is increased by 50% but the accuracy of its physical moves is lowered by 20%. Physical moves with fixed damage have their accuracy reduced, but the damage remains unchanged.  It also boosts the encounter rate of higher level Pokémon in the area by 50% if the user is in the lead.
#056	Contact with the Pokémon may cause infatuation.	An attacking Pokémon has a 30% chance of getting infatuated on contact.  If the user is in the lead, chances of encountering a Pokémon of opposite gender is increased to 66%. This has no effect on genderless Pokémon.
#057	Boosts the Sp. Atk stat of the Pokémon if an ally with the Plus or Minus Ability is also in battle.	Raises the Special Attack of the user if any ally has [ability Minus] or [ability Plus]. The bonus does not count as a stat modifier and will be removed if either ability is removed.
#058	Boosts the Sp. Atk stat of the Pokémon if an ally with the Plus or Minus Ability is also in battle.	Raises the Special Attack of the user if any ally has [ability Minus] or [ability Plus]. The bonus does not count as a stat modifier and will be removed if either ability is removed.
#059	The Pokémon transforms with the weather to change its type to Water, Fire, or Ice.	Changes the user's type and form according to the weather if it is a Castform, except during Sandstorm.  If the weather conditions change to something that does not trigger the ability, the user will revert to normal form.  If the ability is lost or suppressed, the user will revert to its original form until the ability is restored.
#060	Items held by the Pokémon are stuck fast and cannot be removed by other Pokémon.	Prevents an opponent from removing a held item from the user using moves like [move Covet], [move Thief], [move "Knock Off"], [move "Bug Bite"], [move Switcheroo], unless the opponent has [ability "Mold Breaker"], [ability Turboblaze] or [ability Teravolt].  The user can still use moves that involves the loss of its own item (e.g. [move Trick], [move Fling], [move Switcheroo]).  It also makes Pokémon easier to get hooked when fishing if the user is in the lead.
#061	The Pokémon may heal its own status conditions by shedding its skin.	The user has a 33% chance of getting healed from any major status ailment after each turn, before the status activates in case the status is Burn or Poison.
#062	It’s so gutsy that having a status condition boosts the Pokémon’s Attack stat.	Increases the user's Attack by 50% when it has a major status ailment, and ignores the attack cut associated with Burn.  The boost is not counted as a stat boost.
#063	The Pokémon’s marvelous scales boost the Defense stat if it has a status condition.	Increases the user's Defense by 50% when it has a major status ailment.  The boost is not counted as a stat boost.
#064	Oozed liquid has strong stench, which damages attackers using any draining move.	The opponent loses the amount of HP it would have gained when using a leeching move on the user, including [move Absorb], [move "Mega Drain"], [move "Giga Drain"], [move "Leech Life"] and [move "Leech Seed"]. Liquid Ooze does not affect [move "Dream Eater"]. 
#065	Powers up Grass-type moves when the Pokémon’s HP is low.	The user's Grass-type moves inflict 50% more damage when the user's HP drops to 33% or lower of its max HP.
#066	Powers up Fire-type moves when the Pokémon’s HP is low.	The user's Fire-type moves inflict 50% more damage when the user's HP drops to 33% or lower of its max HP.
#067	Powers up Water-type moves when the Pokémon’s HP is low.	The user's Water-type moves inflict 50% more damage when the user's HP drops to 33% or lower of its max HP.
#068	Powers up Bug-type moves when the Pokémon’s  low.	The user's Bug-type moves inflict 50% more damage when the user's HP drops to 33% or lower of its max HP.
#069	Protects the Pokémon from recoil damage.	The user will not receive recoil damage from the moves it uses. Crash damage from [move "Jump Kick"] and [move "Hi Jump Kick"] still occurs. The recoil from [move Struggle] still occurs.  The recoil received from using [item Life Orb], [item "Jaboca Berry"] and [item "Rowap Berry"] still occurs.
#070	Turns the sunlight harsh when the Pokémon enters a battle.	Summons harsh sunlight that lasts for 5 turns upon entering battle unless replaced by a different weather condition before then.  When multiple abilities that change weather upon entering battle activate, the last one to activate will override the weather change.  The number of turns the harsh sunlight remains active can be increased if the user holds a [item "Heat Rock"].
#071	Prevents opposing Pokémon from fleeing.	Prevents an opponent from switching out or escaping (including via [move Teleport]).  Opponents immune to Ground-type moves are immune to the ability (e.g. Flying-type Pokémon, though [ability Levitate], [move "Magnet Rise"], [move Telekinesis], [item "Air Balloon"]). If a normally immune opponent is made vulnerable to Ground-type moves (e.g. through change of typing, suppression or change in ability, holding [item "Iron Ball"], affected by [move Gravity] or [move "Smack Down"]), the opponent will be affected by Arena Trap. [move U-Turn], [move "Volt Switch"], [move "Baton Pass"], [move "Parting Shot"] still allows an opponent to switch out. Holding [item "Shed Shell"] allows an opponent to switch out, but not escape or [move Teleport]. Having [ability "Run Away"] or holding [item "Smoke Ball"] allows escaping but not switching out.  Ghost-type Pokémon are immune to Arena Trap.  It also doubles the encounter rate of Pokémon in the overworld.
#072	The Pokémon is full of vitality, and that prevents it from falling asleep.	The user cannot be inflicted with Sleep.  The user cannot use the [move Rest]. If the user acquired the ability while asleep (including regaining a lost ability through switch out), it will immediately wake up.  It also boosts the encounter rate of higher level Pokémon in the area by 50% if the user is in the lead.
#073	The Pokémon is protected by its white smoke, which prevents other Pokémon from lowering its stats.	The opponent cannot lower the user's stats by using a move or ability that specifically lower the stats of the target.
#074	Using its pure power, the Pokémon doubles its Attack stat.	Doubles the attack of the user when in battle.  This stat boost is not counted as a stat modifier.
#075	A hard shell protects the Pokémon from critical hits.	Moves cannot land Critical Hits on the user.
#076	Eliminates the effects of weather.	Negates all effects of weather, but does not prevent the weather itself.
#077	Raises evasion if the Pokémon is confused.	Increases evasion of the user by 20% when confused. The boost ends when confusion ends
#078	Boosts its Speed stat if hit by an Electric-type move, instead of taking damage.	Protects the user from Electric-type moves, will not miss, will negate all effects of those moves and will raise the Speed of the user by 50% if the user is not protected from the move (e.g. by having Earth-typing). The ability has priority over [item "Cell Battery"] and activates through [move Substitute].
#079	Becomes competitive and deals more damage to Pokémon of the same gender, but deals less to Pokémon of the opposite gender.	Increases damage inflicted by the user against opponents of the same gender by 25%, but decreases damage against the opposite gender by 25%.  The ability has no effect if either Pokémon are genderless.
#080	The Pokémon’s determination boosts the Speed stat each time the Pokémon flinches.	The user's Speed is raised by 50% upon flinching.  Flinching caused when using [move "Focus Punch"] and failing to do so does not activate this ability.
#081	Boosts evasion in a hailstorm.	Increases the evasion of the user by 25% during a hail.  It also protects the user against hail damage if the user does not have the Ice typing.  It also lowers the encounter rate in an area by 50% with blizzard if the user is in the lead.
#082	Makes the Pokémon eat a held Berry when its HP drops to half or less, which is sooner than usual.	Causes the user to eat any held berry triggered by low HP when it falls to or below 50% of its HP, ignoring the usual threshold.
#083	The Pokémon is angered when it takes a critical hit, and that maxes its Attack stat.	Raises the Attack of the user to 6 stages (4 times its original Attack) when the user is hit with a critical hit.
#084	Boosts the Speed stat if the Pokémon’s held item is used or lost.	Doubles the speed of the user when it uses or loses its held item. If the user gains an item or leaves the battle, the boost is lost.  The bonus does not count as a stat modifier.
#085	The heatproof body of the Pokémon halves the damage from Fire-type moves that hit it.	Halves damage the user receives from Fire moves and burns.
#086	The stat changes the Pokémon receives are doubled.	Doubles the user's stat modifiers. These doubled modifiers are still capped at -6 or 6 stages.
#087	Restores HP in rain or when hit by Water-type moves. Reduces HP in sunshine, and increases the damage received from Fire-type moves.	The user takes 12.5% of its max HP as damage each turn during strong sunlight, but heals for 12.5% of its max HP during rain. Increases damage received from Fire-type moves by 25%, but absorbs Water-type moves, healing for 25% of the  HP.  The ability has priority over held items and works through [move Substitute].
#088	Compares an opposing Pokémon’s Defense and Sp. Def stats before raising its own Attack or Sp. Atk stat—whichever will be more effective.	Raises the user's attack stat corresponding to the opponents' weaker defense by 1 stage upon entering battle. In case the Defense and Special Defense stats tie, the Special Attack of the user is boosted instead.  In multi battles, the sum of the opponents' Defense and Special Defense determine the boosted attack.  the ability activates when acquired and boosts from the ability are lost when the ability is lost or suppressed.
#089	Powers up punching moves.	The user's punch-based moves get a 20% boost in base power.  Punch-based moves include [move "Hammer Arm"], [move "Meteor Mash"] and [move "Sky Uppercut"] besides the moves with 'Punch' in their names, but excludes [move "Sucker Punch"].
#090	Restores HP if the Pokémon is poisoned, instead of losing HP.	The user recovers 12.5% of its max HP after each turn when poisoned or badly poisoned in place of taking damage.  If the user is badly poisoned, the toxic counters still continue, meaning that if the ability is lost or suppressed, the user will take the damage normally taken after the number of turns spent under toxic.
#091	Powers up moves of the same type as the Pokémon.	Boosts the same-type attack bonus of the user from 1.5× to 2×.
#092	Maximizes the number of times multi-strike moves hit.	The user's multi-hit moves always hit the maximum number of times.  [move "Triple Kick"]'s accuracy checks for the second and third hit are bypassed.  If the ability is lost or suppressed in the middle of hits (e.g. through [ability Mummy], the attack used still hits for the maximum number of times.
#093	Heals status conditions if it’s raining.	The user is cured of any major status ailment after each turn during rain.
#094	Boosts the Sp. Atk stat in sunny weather, but HP decreases every turn.	Increases the user's Special Attack by 50% but the user loses 12.5% of its max HP after each turn during strong sunlight.
#095	Boosts the Speed stat if the Pokémon has a status condition.	Increases the user's Speed by 50% with when it has a major status ailment, and ignores the cut in Speed caused by Paralysis.  It also reduces the encounter rate of Pokémon in the area by 50% if the user is in the lead.
#096	All the Pokémon’s moves become Normal type. The power of those moves is boosted a little.	Makes the user's moves all act Normal-type; being not very effective on Rock and Steel-types and ineffective on Ghost-types. Typeless moves remain typeless. [move "Weather Ball"] is forced to be normal type but still changes appearance and power under appropriate weather. [move "Will-O-Wisp"] for example will not activate [ability "Flash Fire"] and will not burn Fire-types since they are immune to burn. [move "Flying Press"] deals Normal/Flying-type damage. [move Electrify] and [move "Ion Deluge"] apply after Normalize.
#097	Powers up moves if they become critical hits when attacking.	The user's critical hits deal 50% more damage than usual.
#098	The Pokémon only takes damage from attacks.	The user is immune to indirect damage (status ailments, field hazards, weather, recoil); other effects like Atk cut from Burn still apply. [move "Leech Seed"] and [ability "Liquid Ooze"] will damage/heal neither the user nor the opponent. An opponent will not consume their [item "Jaboca Berry"] or [item "Rowap Berry"] when hit by the user. Self-inflicted damage such as [move "Belly Drum"], [move "Pain Split"], [move Curse], [move Substitute] and [move Struggle], self knockout moves and confusion damage still apply. Turn counters on bad poison still continue despite the damage being negated.
#099	The Pokémon employs no-guard tactics to ensure incoming and outgoing attacks always land.	Moves used by or against the user never miss (except OHKO moves), even if the target is using [move Dig], [move Fly], [move Bounce], [move Dive], [move "Shadow Force"] or [move "Phantom Force"].  Doubles the chances of wild Pokémon encounter in the overworld if the user is in the lead.
#100	The Pokémon moves after all other Pokémon do.	The user will move last within the same move priority order. If there are multiple users of Stall, their speed determines the order of their moves.  The effects of [item "Full Incense"] and [item "Lagging Tail"] have priority over the ability, meaning the holder of such items will move after the user. If the user is holding either items, the ability is ignored.  The ability still makes the user move last during [move "Trick Room"].
#101	Powers up the Pokémon’s weaker moves.	The user's moves with final base power of 60 or less have their base power raised by 50%, including [move Struggle].  Self inflicted damage due to confusion which has a base power of 40 does not get boosted.
#102	Prevents status conditions in sunny weather.	The user cannot be inflicted with major status ailments during strong sunlight.  The ability does not heal those inflicted before the required conditions are in place for the ability to activate.  [move Yawn] and [move Rest] will fail to activate. An already-used [move Yawn] will fail if the required conditions are subsequently met on the turn [move Yawn] takes effect.
#103	The Pokémon can’t use any held items.	Items the user holds are completely ignored. The user cannot use [move Fling].  Items that do not affect the course of battles work (e.g. [item "Exp. Share"], [item "Amulet Coin"], [item "Soothe Bell"]).  Other moves that use held items such as [move "Natural Gift"] and [move Switcheroo] work as usual. The ability does not prevent the use of Mega Stones.
#104	Moves can be used on the target regardless of its Abilities.	The user's moves ignore the target's abilities that would otherwise hinder or prevent their current effect on the target, or their resolving moves (e.g. [move Spike]).
#105	The Pokémon is so lucky that the critical-hit ratios of its moves are boosted.	The user has its moves' critical hit rates raised by one stage.
#106	Damages the attacker if it contacts the Pokémon with a finishing hit.	Damages the attacker for 25% its max HP when the user is knocked out by a contact move.
#107	The Pokémon can sense an opposing Pokémon's dangerous moves.	Notifies all trainers upon entering battle if an opponent has a super-effective move, Self-Destruct, Explosion, or a one-hit KO move. The move itself is not revealed. [move Counter], [move "Mirror Coat"] and [move "Metal Burst"] count as attacking moves of their respective types, while [move Bide], [move "Hidden Power"], [move Judgement], [move "Natural Gift"], [move "Techno Blast"] and [move "Weather Ball"] are considered to be Normal-type.
#108	When it enters a battle, the Pokémon can tell one of the moves an opposing Pokémon has.	Reveals the opponents' strongest move upon entering battle (among all opponents if there are multiple). In the event of a tie, one of the moves is chosen at random.  Moves with no specific damage are listed as having a power of: 160 for OHKO moves ([move "Sheer Cold"], [move Guillotine], [move "Horn Drill"], [move Fissure]), 120 for counter move ([move Counter], [move "Metal Burst"], [move "Mirror Coat"]), 80 for moves with variable damage ([move "Crush Grip"], [move "Dragon Rage"], [move "Electro Ball"], [move Endeavor], [move "Final Gambit"], [move Flail], [move Frustration], [move "Grass Knot"], [move "Gyro Ball"], [move "Heat Crash"], [move "Heavy Slam"], [move "Hidden Power"], [move "Low Kick"], [move "Natural Gift"], [move "Night Shade"], [move Psywave], [move Return], [move Reversal], [move "Seismic Toss"], [move "Sonic Boom"], [move "Trump Card"], [move "Wring Out"]) and 0 for any other variable damage move.
#109	When attacking, the Pokémon ignores the target Pokémon's stat changes.	If the user uses a damaging move or is damaged by a damaging move, the opponent's stat stages are ignored during damage and accuracy calculation.  If the user attacks, the Defense, Special Defense and Evasion stat changes of the target are ignored. If the user gets attacked, the opponent's Attack, Special Attack and Accuracy stat changes are ignored. The power of [move Punishment] and [move "Stored Power"] are calculated normally.
#110	The Pokémon can use “not very effective” moves to deal regular damage. 	Doubles damage inflicted with not-very-effective moves.
#111	Reduces the power of supereffective attacks taken.	Decreases damage received from super effective moves by 25%.
#112	For five turns, the Pokémon’s Attack and Speed stats are halved.	Halves Attack and Speed of the user for five turns upon entering battle. If the user loses and regains the ability without leaving the field, the user's 5 turn counter continues from where it was.
#113	The Pokémon can hit Ghost-type Pokémon with Normal- and Fighting-type moves.	The Normal and Fighting-types moves of the user ignore the Ghost-type immunity of Ghost-type opponents.
#114	Draws in all Water-type moves. Instead of being hit by Water-type moves, it boosts its Sp. Atk.	Redirects all single-target Water moves (except [move "Water Pledge"], but including [move Soak]) to this Pokémon where possible; nullifying the damage, accuracy calculations and any secondary effect; and raising the user's Special Attack by one stage.  When multiple Pokémon with the ability are present on the field, the one with the highest Speed becomes the target and in case of a tie, it is random between them.  [move "Follow Me"] takes priority over the ability.
#115	The Pokémon gradually regains HP in a hailstorm.	Heals for 6.25% max HP after each turn during hail and nullifies hail damage.
#116	Reduces the power of supereffective attacks taken.	Decreases damage received from super-effective moves by 25%.
#117	The Pokémon summons a hailstorm when it enters a battle.	Summons hail that lasts for 5 turns upon entering battle unless replaced by a different weather condition before then.  When multiple abilities that change weather upon entering battle activate, the last one to activate will override the weather change.  The number of turns the harsh sunlight remains active can be increased if the user holds a [item "Icy Rock"].
#118	The Pokémon may gather Honey after a battle.	The user may pick up Honey after battle. The odds start at 5% and increments by 5% every 10th level from level 1 to 10, by 10% from 11 to 20 and so on up to by 50% from 91 to 100.
#119	When it enters a battle, the Pokémon can check an opposing Pokémon’s held item.	Reveals the opponent's held item upon entering battle.  In a multi battle, it will reveal the item on all opponents.
#120	Powers up moves that have recoil damage.	The user's recoil moves have their power boosted by 20% (excluding [move Struggle]).
#121	Changes the Pokémon’s type to match the Plate or Z-Crystal it holds.	Changes Arceus' type and form to match its held Plate.  Item removing effects of [move Thief], [move Covet], [move Trick], [move Switcheroo] and [move "Knock Off"] will not work on the user if the user is holding a plate.  Transforming into the user will copy the form and type of the userregardless of its held plate.  The user's ability cannot be negated or overwritten by [move "Role Play"], [move "Gastro Acid"], [move "Worry Seed"], [move "Simple Beam"], [move Entrainment], or [ability Mummy]; [move "Skill Swap"] will fail and, [ability Trace] cannot copy it. Type changing moves like [move Soak] will fail on the user ([move "forest's Curse"] and [move "Trick-Or-Treat"] work as usual).
#122	Boosts the Attack and Sp. Def stats of itself and allies when it is sunny.	Boosts Attack and Special Defense of ally Pokémon by 50% during harsh sunlight.
#123	Reduces the HP of sleeping opposing Pokémon.	Damages sleeping opponents for 12.5% their max HP after each turn.

#125	Removes additional effects to increase the power of moves when attacking.	Boosts the power moves with extra effects by 30%, but erases their extra effects.
#126	Makes stat changes have an opposite effect.	Stat changes are reversed. This does not affect stat changes due to secondary effects of status ailments.
#127	Unnerves opposing Pokémon and makes them unable to eat Berries.	Prevents opposing Pokémon from eating held Berries.
#128	Boosts the Pokémon’s Attack stat sharply when its stats are lowered.	The user's Attack is raised by two stages upon having any stat lowered.

#132	Reduces damage done to allies.	Reduces the damage taken from allies by 25%.

#148	Boosts move power when the Pokémon moves last.	If the user moves last, its power is boosted by 30%.
#149	Comes out disguised as the Pokémon in the party's last spot.	The user takes the name, gender, appearance, Pokeball, form if any and shininess if any of the last conscious Pokémon in the trainer's party upon being sent out, until hit by a damaging move, or the ability is negated or removed. If the user is hit by a multi-strike move, the user takes its original appearance after the first hit.  All calculations are based on the user's original identity (e.g. calculations or effects that depend on gender and weight).  [move "Role Play"] will fail on the user, [move "Skill Swap"] will fail if any or the user or the target has the ability, [ability Trace] does not copy the ability, and if a Pokémon obtains the ability through [move Transform] or [ability Illusion], it will not disguise itself.
#150	The Pokémon transforms itself into the Pokémon it's facing.	The user transforms when it is sent out, mimicking the move [move Transform] in all respects. The ability will not activate if the opponent is transformed, disguised with [ability Illusion] or behind a [move Substitute]. In multibattles, the user will transform into the opponent directly opposite, or if there are none, the ability will fail to activate.  [move "Role Play"] fails if the target has the ability, [move Entrainment] fails if the user has the ability, [ability Trace] cannot copy the ability.
#151	Passes through the opposing Pokémon’s barrier, substitute, and the like and strikes.	The user will ignore the effects of a target's [move Reflect], [move "Light Screen"], [move Safeguard], [move Substitute], [move Mist] and [move "Aurora Veil"].
#152	Contact with the Pokémon changes the attacker's Ability to Mummy.	When the user is hit by a contact move, the attacker's ability will change to Mummy. If the user is hit by a multi-strike move, the attacker will have its ability changed after the first strike.  If the attacker with [ability "Rock Head"] attacks the user with a recoil move, its ability will change to Mummy before recoil damage is inflicted, thus causing the attacker to take recoil damage. If the attacker has the ability [ability "Parental Bond"], Mummy activates after the first strike, but the attacker still proceeds with the next attack.  The ability cannot be copied on Pokémon having the ability [ability Multitype] or [ability "Stance Change"].
#153	The Pokémon shows moxie, and that boosts the Attack stat after knocking out any Pokémon.	Raises the user's Attack by one stage upon knocking out a Pokémon.  If the user knocks out a Pokémon with [ability Mummy], it loses its ability before the Attack is boosted.
#154	Being hit by a Dark-type move boosts the Attack stat of the Pokémon, for justice.	Raises the user's Attack by one stage upon being hit by a Dark-type move.  If the user is hit with a multi-hit move, each hit activates the ability.
#155	Dark-, Ghost-, and Bug-type moves scare the Pokémon and boost its Speed stat.	Raises the user's Speed by one stage upon being hit by a Dark-type, Ghost-type, or Bug-type move.  If the user is hit with a multi-hit move, each hit activates the ability.
#156	Reflects status moves, instead of getting hit by them.	Reflects the effect of status moves (excluding [move Memento]) that target the user back at the attacker. These moves can still miss.  The ability does not activate if the user is immune against the move being used due to its type or species (e.g. a Ground-type Pokémon being targeted by [move "Thunder Wave"] or Dugtrio being targeted by [move Telekinesis]) or if the user is protected from the move. It can reflect a move even if the move would fail (e.g. [move Disable] used on a Pokémon that has not used a move or is already disabled) or have no effect on the target (e.g. [move "Feather Dance"] when the target already has -6 Attack).  If a move targets multiple Pokémon individually (such as [move "Heal Block"] or [move Growl]), it will still affect each Pokémon that does not have Magic Bounce normally, then each Pokémon that has Magic Bounce will reflect the move individually. If a move targets the entire ally field (such as entry hazard moves), Magic Bounce will reflect the move completely (if multiple allies have Magic Bounce, only one will activate).  Does not activate if the move is used by a Pokémon with [ability Teravolt], [ability Turboblaze], or [ability "Mold Breaker"].  Only activates once per turn.  Magic Bounce cannot reflect a move that was just reflected by [move "Magic Coat"] or Magic Bounce. Does not activate if the user is in off the field (e.g. using [move Fly]).
#157	Boosts the Attack stat if hit by a Grass-type move, instead of taking damage.	Grass-type moves targetting the user are negated and raise its Attack by one stage. Multi-strike moves, such as [move "Bullet Seed"] will activate the raise in Attack stat only once per move.  The ability does not activate if the user is protected from the move.
#158	Gives priority to a status move.	Raises the priority of the user's status moves by one unless the target is a Dark-type Pokémon.  These moves are considered priority moves and as such can be blocked using [move "Quick Guard"].
#159	Boosts the power of Rock-, Ground-, and Steel-type moves in a sandstorm.	Raises the user's Rock-type, Ground-type and Steel-type moves by 30% during a sandstorm. Protects the user against sandstorm damage.
#160	Inflicts damage to the attacker on contact with iron barbs.	Each time an opponent hits the user with a contact move, they receive 12.5% of their max HP as damage.  If Iron Barbs causes both Pokémon to faint, the attacker will faint first.
#161	Changes the Pokémon’s shape when HP is half or less.	Changes Darmanitan's form at the start and at the end of each turn depending on its HP: Zen Mode below 50% max HP, and Standard Mode otherwise.  If Darmanitan loses the ability, it will revert to Standard Mode if it is in Zen Mode and be unable to change mode. If Darmanitan acquires the ability, it will change form at the end of the turn depending on its HP at that point.  [move Entrainment] and [ability Trace] fail on the user. 
#162	Boosts the accuracy of its allies and itself.	Increases the move accuracy all allies (including the user) by 10%.
#163	Moves can be used on the target regardless of its Abilities.	The user's moves ignore the target's abilities that would otherwise hinder or prevent their current effect on the target, or their resolving moves (e.g. [move Spike]).

#176	The Pokémon changes its form to Blade Forme when it uses an attack move, and changes to Shield Form when it uses King’s Shield.	The user changes to Blade Forme whenever it uses a damaging move (even if asleep or confused). The forme change does not occur for moves that call damaging moves such as Sleep Talk.  The user can revert back to Shield Forme if it uses [King's Shield].

#189	The Pokémon changes the weather to nullify Fire-type attacks.	The weather changes to extremely heavy rain, causing the following to fail: Fire-type damaging moves (unless the user of that move has [ability "Cloud Nine"] or [ability "Air Lock"]), weather modifying moves and most weather modifying abilities.  Primordial Sea activates when the user switches in or when the ability is gained. In rotation battle, it does not activate when the user is sent out in a rotated-out position or when the user is rotated in.  The effect stops if the user is switched out, rotated out in a rotation battle, if the ability is suppressed or replaced, or if [ability "Desolate Land"] or [ability "Delta Stream"] activates.
#190	The Pokémon changes the weather to nullify Water-type attacks.	The weather changes to extremely harsh sunlight, causing the following to fail: Water-type damaging moves (unless the user of that move has [ability "Cloud Nine"] or [ability "Air Lock"]), weather modifying moves and most weather modifying abilities.  Desolate Land activates when the user switches in or when the ability is gained. In rotation battle, it does not activate when the user is sent out in a rotated-out position or when the user is rotated in.  The effect stops if the user is switched out, rotated out in a rotation battle, if the ability is suppressed or replaced, or if [ability "Primordial Sea"] or [ability "Delta Stream"] activates.
#191	The Pokémon changes the weather to eliminate all of the Flying type’s weaknesses.	The weather changes to extremely windy, causing super effective moves hitting Flying-type Pokémon neutral moves instead. Delta Stream does not affect [move "Stealth Rock"] or [ability Anticipate].  Delta Stream activates when the user switches in or when the ability is gained. In rotation battle, it does not activate when the user is sent out in a rotated-out position or when the user is rotated in.  The effect stops if the user is switched out, rotated out in a rotation battle, if the ability is suppressed or replaced, or if [ability "Primordial Sea"] or [ability "Delta Stream"] activates.
#192	Boosts the Defense stat when hit by an attack.	The user's Defense is raised by one stage each time it is hit by an attack. Each hit from a multi-strike move will activate the ability.
#193	The Pokémon cowardly switches out when its HP becomes half or less.	When the HP of the user goes from above 50% to below 50%, it will either flee from a wild battle or switch out in a trainer battle if it doesn't faint. The ability does not activate if the user self inflicted damage or received damage from the field, or if the user's HP goes back to above 50% immediately after suffering damage.  If the user is hit by a move affected by [move "Sheer Force"], the ability will not activate. The ability only activates after the last hit of a multi-strike move. If the ability activates from [move "Volt Switch"] or [move U-turn], the user of that move will not switch out. Trapping moves will not prevent the ability from activating.  If the user holds a [item "Red Card"], both will activate. If the user holds an [item "Eject Button"], the item will activate before the ability gets to activate. [move "Dragon Tail"] and [move "Circle Throw"] switch out the user before the ability gets to activate.
#194	The Pokémon, sensing danger, switches out when its HP becomes half or less.	When the HP of the user goes from above 50% to below 50%, it will either flee from a wild battle or switch out in a trainer battle if it doesn't faint.

If the user is hit by a move affected by [move "Sheer Force"], the ability will not activate. The ability only activates after the last hit of a multi-strike move. If the ability activates from [move "Volt Switch"] or [move U-turn], the user of that move will not switch out. Trapping moves will not prevent the ability from activating.  If the user holds a [item "Red Card"], both will activate. If the user holds an [item "Eject Button"], the item will activate before the ability gets to activate. [move "Dragon Tail"] and [move "Circle Throw"] switch out the user before the ability gets to activate.

#196	The Pokémon’s attacks become critical hits if the target is poisoned.	The user's attacks on a Poisoned target will always be critical hits, unless the target has the ability [ability "Battle Armor"], [ability "Shell Armor"] or is under the effect of [move "Lucky Chant"].
#197	When its HP becomes half or less, the Pokémon’s shell breaks and it becomes aggressive.	At the start of a battle or at the end of a turn, the user will change to Meteor Form if its HP is above 50% of its total HP or to Core Form otherwise. While in Meteor Form, the user cannot be afflicted by status ailments or become drowsy due to [move Yawn], and [move Rest] will fail. If the user in Core Form is switched in while grounded, it will be poisoned by [move "Toxic Spikes"] before the ability changes it to Meteor Form.  The ability cannot be suppressed, copied, replaced or ignored/bypassed.  If the user acquires the ability through [move Transform] or [ability Imposter], it will not activate or have any effect.  If the user gets inflicted by a status ailment while in Core Form and later reverts to Meteor Form, the user will not be cured by the change in Form.
#198	Doubles the damage dealt to the target’s replacement if the target switches out.	The power of the user is doubled if the target has switched in this turn.
#199	Lowers the power of Fire-type moves done to the Pokémon and prevents the Pokémon from getting a burn.

#200	Powers up Steel-type moves.	The user's Steel-type moves have their power increased by 50%.
#201	Boosts the Pokémon’s Sp. Atk stat when it takes a hit that causes its HP to become half or less.

#202	Boosts the Pokémon’s Speed stat in a hailstorm.	Doubles the user's Speed during a hailstorm.
#203	The Pokémon uses its moves without making contact with the target.	User's moves that make contact with a target will not activate any effects caused by contact.

#206	Normal-type moves become Electric-type moves. The power of those moves is boosted a little.	Normal-type moves of the user become Electric-type and get boosted by 20%.
#207	Doubles the Pokémon’s Speed stat on Electric Terrain.	While [move "Electric Terrain"] is active, the user's Speed is doubled.
#208	When it has a lot of HP, the Pokémon forms a powerful school. It stops schooling when its HP is low.	If the user is level 20 or above and, at the start or the end of the turn, has an HP above 25%, it will change into School Form. Otherwise, it will keep or return to its Solo Form.  The ability cannot be suppressed, copied or replaced. If the user acquires the ability through [move Transform] or [ability Imposter], it will not activate or have any effect. 
#209	Once per battle, the shroud that covers the Pokémon can protect it from an attack.	If the user is hit by a damaging move or hits itself in Confusion, Disguise will take the damage and leave the user unharmed, while additional effects will still apply. Once it activates, the user will go from Disguised Form to Busted Form, and will remain so for the remaining of the battle. If the user's type was changed while in Disguise Form, it will be restored when changed to Busted Form.  The ability is not triggered by passive damage, but is triggered at the first hit of a multi-strike move. [move Substitute] takes priority over the ability.  The ability cannot be suppressed, copied or replaced. If the user acquires the ability through [move Transform] or [ability Imposter], it will not activate or have any effect.  Moves and abilities that ignore abilities will ignore the ability and not activate it.  [ability Mummy] will affect the user only if it is in Busted Form.
#210	Defeating an opposing Pokémon strengthens the Pokémon’s bond with its Trainer, and it becomes Ash-Greninja. Water Shuriken gets more powerful.	The user will change form after it causes an opponent to faint. The user's [move "Water Shuriken"]'s base power is increased to 20 and always hits 3 times. If the user faints during the battle, it will revert to its original form and will not change form again if revived until the battle is over.  The ability cannot be suppressed, copied or replaced. If the user acquires the ability through [move Transform] or [ability Imposter], it will not activate or have any effect.  Moves and abilities that ignore abilities will ignore the ability and not activate it.  In the overworld, pairing the user with any other Pokémon will not yield any eggs.
#211	Other Cells gather to aid when its HP becomes half or less. Then the Pokémon changes its form to Complete Forme.	At the end of a turn where the user's HP is below 50% of its full HP, the user will transform into its Complete Forme. Its stats are recalculated based on the resulting form, its HP will be adjusted to keep the same HP lost (this is not counted as healing) and its typing reset, if changed. At the end of the battle, the user reverts to its previous form and its remaining HP will be equal to the Complete Forme's remaining HP, or at full HP if the Complete Forme had more HP than the maximum HP the original form could have.  The ability cannot be suppressed, copied or replaced. If the user acquires the ability through [move Transform] or [ability Imposter], it will not activate or have any effect.
#212	The Pokémon can poison the target even if it’s a Steel or Poison type.	The user can inflict Poison when using a move on a target regardless of their type. Poison resulting from indirect effects such as [move "Toxic Spikes"] or [move "Magic Coat"] or [ability "Magic Bounce"] or [ability "Synchronize"]. If the user it will badly poison itself regardless of type if it holds a [item "Toxic Orb"].  The user can poison a target regardless of type if it uses [move Fling] while holding a [item "Poison Barb"] or a [item "Toxic Orb"].
#213	It’s always drowsing and will never wake up. It can attack without waking up.	The user acts as if it was asleep, without getting the Sleep ailment. The user cannot be afflicted with major status ailment or get drowsy from [move Yawn]. The user can use moves that can normally only be used when asleep (e.g. [move Snore]), is affected by moves that can normally only be used on asleep Pokémon (e.g. [move "Dream Eater"]), cannot use [move Rest] successfully and takes boosted power from [move Hex] and [move "Wake-Up Slap"].  The user is unaffected by effects that prevent sleep.   The ability cannot be suppressed, copied, replaced or ignored/bypassed.  If the user acquires the ability through [move Transform] or [ability Imposter], it will not activate or have any effect.  If the user was inflicted by a status ailment before getting the ability, the status ailment will behave as usual, ignoring Comatose.
#214	Its majesty pressures the opposing Pokémon, making it unable to attack using priority moves.	When targetted by a priority move (including moves which have their priority raised through effects), the user prevents the move from being executed, while the PP is still consumed.  Moves that target multiple targets at the same time are not blocked if they have their priority raised.  Z-Moves with raised priority will only have their Z-Power effect activate while the move itself is blocked.
#215	Damages the attacker landing the finishing hit by the amount equal to its last HP.	The user deals damage equal to the HP it had before fainting to the attacker when it faints. If the user faints from a multi-turn move, the ability will activate only if the user of that move is still on the field.
#216	When another Pokémon uses a dance move, it can use a dance move following it regardless of its Speed.	Whenever a Pokémon on the field uses a dance-based move, the user will immediately use the same move, separate from the move it was ordered to use. The ability does not activate for a dance-based move if that move was copied via Dance, failed to affect any Pokémon, [move Snatch]ed, reflected by [move "Magic Coat"] or [ability "Magic Bounce"] (for both the initial use and the reflected move) or if the user is flinched.  The ability will copy the original move of a Dance-based Z-Move, can copy an [move Instruct]ed move and a dance-based status move despite holding an [item "Assault Vest"].  If the user is confused, it might still hurt itself instead of copying the move, even if it is protected. If the user is locked into a move or a set of moves (e.g. [move Encore], [item "Choice Band"], [move "Petal Dance"], [move Taunt]), it will try to copy the move but will fail if the copied move is not a move the restriction allows it to use. If the user is locked into a multi-turn move and the ability copies the same move (e.g. the user is locked in [move "Petal Dance"] and Dancer copies it), the copied move will not count towards the turn duration of the move. Copying a multi-turn move will not lock the user into that move.  Moves copied from Dancer are [move Snatch]able and can be reflected. Moves copied from Dancer themselves are not considered to be the most recently used moves, but the damage, if any, are considered for [move "Mirror Coat"] and [move "Metal Burst"].
#217	Powers up ally Pokémon’s special moves.	The power of allies' Special moves are increased by 30%.
#218	Halves the damage taken from moves that make direct contact, but doubles that of Fire-type moves.	The user takes half the damage it would have sustained from contact moves, but takes double the damage it would from Fire-type moves. Fire-type moves that make contact deal normal damage. Moves affected by [ability "Long Reach"] or [item "Protective Pads"] deal normal damage.
#219	Surprises the opposing Pokémon, making it unable to attack using priority moves.	When targetted by a priority move (including moves which have their priority raised through effects), the user prevents the move from being executed, while the PP is still consumed.  Moves that target multiple targets at the same time are not blocked if they have their priority raised.  Z-Moves with raised priority will only have their Z-Power effect activate while the move itself is blocked.
#220	Boosts its Sp. Atk stat every time a Pokémon faints.	Raises the user's Special Attack by one stage every time a Pokémon on the field faints.
#221	Contact with the Pokémon lowers the attacker’s Speed stat.	The attacker's Speed is lowered by one stage each time it hits the user with a contact move. Each hit from a multi-strike move will activate the ability.
#222	The Pokémon copies the Ability of a defeated ally.	The user copies the ability of the Pokémon which fainted prior to the user's switch in, except if the fainted Pokémon had the abilities: Receiver, [ability "Power of Alchemy"], [ability Trace], [ability Forecast], [ability "Flower Gift"], [ability Multitype], [ability Illusion], [ability "Wonder Guard"], [ability "Zen Mode"], [ability Imposter], [ability "Stance Change"], [ability "Power Construct"], [ability Schooling], [ability Comatose], [ability "Shields Down"], [ability Disguise], [ability "RKS System"], or [ability "Battle Bond"]. The ability cannot be copied by [move "Role Play"] or [ability Trace]. [move "Role Play"] and [move Entrainment] fail if used by the user.
#223	The Pokémon copies the Ability of a defeated ally.	The user copies the ability of the Pokémon which fainted prior to the user's switch in, except if the fainted Pokémon had the abilities: Receiver, [ability "Power of Alchemy"], [ability Trace], [ability Forecast], [ability "Flower Gift"], [ability Multitype], [ability Illusion], [ability "Wonder Guard"], [ability "Zen Mode"], [ability Imposter], [ability "Stance Change"], [ability "Power Construct"], [ability Schooling], [ability Comatose], [ability "Shields Down"], [ability Disguise], [ability "RKS System"], or [ability "Battle Bond"]. The ability cannot be copied by [move "Role Play"] or [ability Trace]. [move "Role Play"] and [move Entrainment] fail if used by the user.
#224	The Pokémon boosts its most proficient stat each time it knocks out a Pokémon.	When the user causes a Pokémon on the field to faint through direct damage, its highest stat (other than HP) gets raised by one stage. If this stat cannot be raised any higher, the ability will not activate. The ability does not take into account stat stages, held items and stat ailment debuffs when determining the stat to be raised, but considers [move "Power Split"], [move "Guard Split"], [move "Power Trick"], [move "Wonder Room"] and [move "Speed Swap"]. In case of a tie, the stat to be raised will be prioritized as: Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed.
#225	Changes the Pokémon’s type to match the memory disc it holds.	Changes the type of the user depending on the [item Memory] attached. The user is immune to the effects of moves that takes away a [item Memory] from it and its type cannot be replaced (e.g. through [move Soak]) even though a type can be added to its current type.  The ability cannot be suppressed, copied or replaced.  If the user acquires the ability through [move Transform] or [ability Imposter], it will copy the form of the target regardless of its own held item.
#226	Turns the ground into Electric Terrain when the Pokémon enters a battle.	Summons [move "Electric Terrain"] that lasts for 5 turns upon entering battle unless replaced by a different terrain effect before then.  When multiple abilities that change terrain upon entering battle activate, the last one to activate will override the terrain change.  The number of turns Electric Terrain remains active can be increased if the user holds a [item "Terrain Extender"].
#227	Turns the ground into Psychic Terrain when the Pokémon enters a battle.	Summons [move "Psychic Terrain"] that lasts for 5 turns upon entering battle unless replaced by a different terrain effect before then.  When multiple abilities that change terrain upon entering battle activate, the last one to activate will override the terrain change.  The number of turns Electric Terrain remains active can be increased if the user holds a [item "Terrain Extender"].
#228	Turns the ground into Misty Terrain when the Pokémon enters a battle.	Summons [move "Misty Terrain"] that lasts for 5 turns upon entering battle unless replaced by a different terrain effect before then.  When multiple abilities that change terrain upon entering battle activate, the last one to activate will override the terrain change.  The number of turns Electric Terrain remains active can be increased if the user holds a [item "Terrain Extender"].
#229	Turns the ground into Grassy Terrain when the Pokémon enters a battle.	Summons [move "Grassy Terrain"] that lasts for 5 turns upon entering battle unless replaced by a different terrain effect before then.  When multiple abilities that change terrain upon entering battle activate, the last one to activate will override the terrain change.  The number of turns Electric Terrain remains active can be increased if the user holds a [item "Terrain Extender"].
#230	Prevents other Pokémon’s moves or Abilities from lowering the Pokémon’s stats.	The opponent cannot lower the user's stats by using a move or ability that specifically lower the stats of the target. The ability cannot be bypassed/ignored.
#231	Reduces the amount of damage the Pokémon takes while its HP is full.	Halves the damage taken by the user when is has full HP. The ability cannot be bypassed/ignored.
#232	Reduces the power of super effective attacks taken.	Decreases damage received from super effective moves by 25%. The ability cannot be bypassed/ignored.
