#009	Contact with the Pokémon may cause paralysis.	An attacking Pokémon has a 30% chance of getting paralyzed on contact.  It also boosts the encounter rate of wild Electric-type Pokémon in the area to 50% if the user is in the lead.
#010	Restores HP if hit by an Electric-type move.	The user absorbs Electric moves, healing for 25% of the user's max HP. Any secondary effects of the Electric move is ignored.  A Ground-type Pokémon will not heal any HP.  It activates behind [move Substitute] but not behind [move Protect].
#011	Restores HP if hit by a Water-type move.	The user absorbs Water-type moves, healing for 25% of the user's max HP. Any secondary effects of the Water-type move is ignored.

Color Change activates on the turn [move Future Sight] is used instead of on the turn the user gets hit.
#017	Prevents the Pokémon from getting poisoned.	The user cannot be inflicted with Poison or Toxic Poison.  If the user acquired the ability while poisoned (including regaining a lost ability through switch out), it will immediately be cured.
#018	Powers up Fire-type moves if hit by a Fire move.	Protects the user against Fire-type moves. Once one has been blocked, the Pokémon's own Fire-type moves inflict 1.5× damage until it leaves battle.  This ability is not activated if the user is Frozen (even if it subsequently thaws out of the Frozen condition on being hit) or if the user has been inflicted with a Burn status.

This ability is also activated if the user receives this ability, unless the user has previously lost the ability through [move "Skill Swap"] and regained it through the same way.  This ability does not work through [move Substitute].  In the overworld, if the user is in the lead, chances of encountering Pokémon of 5 levels lower than the user is decreased by 50%.
#023	Prevents the foe from escaping.	As long as the user is on the field, opponents cannot switch out.  [ability "Run Away"] and the use of items and moves that cause switches will however still allow opponents to switch out.  Pokémon that have this ability are immune to it.
#024	Inflicts damage to the foe on contact.	Each time an opponent hits the user with a contact move, they receive 12.5% of their max HP as damage.  If Rough Skin causes both Pokémon to faint, the attacker will faint first.

Wonder Guard does not block typeless moves such as [move Struggle], [move "Beat Up"], [move "Future Sight"] and [move "Doom Desire"].  Wonder Guard cannot be [move "Skill Swap"]ped or copied by [move "Role Play"], but it can be [ability "Trace"]d.  [move "Worry Seed"] and [move "Gastro Acid"] can suppress Wonder Guard.  [move "Entrainment"] can pass Wander Guard to a target.  Wonder Guard works normally on a [move Substitute] created by the user.
#026	Gives full immunity to all Ground-type moves.	The user is immune to Ground-type moves, [move Spikes], [move "Toxic Spikes"] and [ability "Arena Trap"] except [move "Sand Attack"].

#027	Contact may paralyze, poison, or cause sleep.	Has a 30% chance of inflicting either paralysis, poison, or sleep on attacking Pokémon on contact (9% to inflict poison, 10% to inflict paralysis and 11% to inflict sleep).
#028	Passes on a burn, poison, or paralysis to the foe.	Copies burns, paralysis and poison received onto the Pokémon that inflicted them. Bad poison is copied on as regular poison.  Status ailments not received from another Pokémon (e.g. [move "Toxic Spikes"], [move Rest] or [item "Flame Orb"]) are not copied. [move "Toxic Spikes"] activates Synchronize only if a Pokémon on the field directly causes the user to switch in (e.g. using [move Roar] or [move Whirlwind]). An opponent inflicted with a status ailment targeting the user will be affected by Synchronize.  Wild Pokémon encountered and Pokémon interacted with (excluding roaming Pokémon) have a 50% chance to have the same nature as the user if the user of this ability is in the lead. 
#029	Prevents the Pokémon's stats from being lowered.	The opponent cannot lower the user's stats by using a move that specifically lower the stats of the target.
#030	All status problems are healed upon switching out.	Cures major status ailments of the user when they switch out.  Activates normally even if the ability is a temporary ability.
#031	The Pokémon draws in all Electric-type moves.	Redirects single-target Electric-type moves to the user where possible and will not miss, except Electric-type [move "Hidden Power"], [move Judgement] or [move "Natural Gift"].

#042	Prevents Steel-type Pokémon from escaping.	As long as the user is on the field, Steel-type opponents cannot switch out.  [ability "Run Away"] and the use of items and moves that cause switches will however still allow opponents to switch out.  It also boosts the encounter rate of wild Steel-type Pokémon in the area to 50% if the user is in the lead.
#043	Gives full immunity to all sound-based moves.	The user is immune to sound-based moves.  The effect of [move "Uproar"] prevents the user from sleeping.  The user can still obtain a [move "Perish Song"] counter indirectly (e.g. from [move "Baton Pass"]) and will retain the counter if it obtains Soundproof after being affected by [move "Perish Song"].
#044	The Pokémon gradually recovers HP in rain.	The user recovers 6.25% of its max HP after each turn there is heavy rain.
#045	The Pokémon summons a sandstorm in battle.	Summons sandstorm that lasts indefinitely upon entering battle unless replaced by a different weather condition.  When multiple abilities that change weather upon entering battle activate, the last one to activate will override the weather change.  It also halves the encounter rate of Pokémon in the area if the user is in the lead and there is a sandstorm.
#046	The Pokémon raises the foe's PP usage.	Causes an opponent which targets the user to use up one extra PP if possible, even if the move misses or fails.  The effect of Pressure stacks if there are allies with the same ability and a multi-target move is used.  Pressure affects an ally if the ally uses a move that single targets the user or the entire field.

#050	Enables sure getaway from wild Pokémon.	The user is able to switch out from battles even if trapped.
#051	Prevents the Pokémon from losing accuracy.	The user cannot have its accuracy lowered.  Keen Eye does not prevent any accuracy losses other than stat modifiers.  Negative accuracy modifiers can still be passed through [move Heart Swap].  In the overworld, if the user is in the lead, chances of encountering Pokémon of 5 levels lower than the user is decreased by 50%.
#052	Prevents the Attack stat from being lowered.	The user cannot have its attack lowered by other Pokémon. The ability does not prevent Attack loss other than stat modifiers such as the Attack cut from a burn. The user can still be passed negative Attack modifiers through [move "Heart Swap"] or [move "Power Swap"].
#053	The Pokémon may pick up items.	The user may hold certain items after battle if it is not holding any. The chances of the ability's successful activation and the possible items found depends on the user's level.
#054	The Pokémon can't attack on consecutive turns.	The user will loaf around on every second turn it attempts to use a move.  Multi-turn moves (e.g. [move Bide] or [move Rollout]) are interrupted, moves requiring recharge (e.g. [move "Hyper Beam"]) do not have recharge (but the user cannot be switched out on that turn), moves that require charging (e.g. [move Solarbeam] or [move Fly]) will not end up being used, moves that are forced over multiple turns even through failure (e.g. [move Outrage] and [move Uproar] or moves locked with [move Encore]) will keep going as usual).  Confusion check turns are skipped the turn the user loafs around. If the user attempts to move but fails, it still counts as moving and will loaf around the next turn. If it does not attempt to move (e.g. through sleep or frozen), the next action will be resumed once cured.  The ability cannot be suppressed with [move "Worry Seed"] but can with [move "Gastro Acid"] or changed with [move "Role Play"] or [move "Skill Swap"].
#055	Boosts the Attack stat, but lowers accuracy.	The user's attack is increased by 50% but the accuracy of its physical moves is lowered by 20%. Physical moves with fixed damage have their accuracy reduced, but the damage remains unchanged.  It also boosts the encounter rate of higher level Pokémon in the area by 50% if the user is in the lead.
#056	Contact with the Pokémon may cause infatuation.	An attacking Pokémon has a 30% chance of getting infatuated on contact.  If the user is in the lead, chances of encountering a Pokémon of opposite gender is increased to 66% . This has no effect on genderless or swarming Pokémon.
#057	Boosts Sp. Atk if another Pokémon has Minus.	Raises the Special Attack of the user if any ally has [ability Minus]. The bonus does not count as a stat modifier and will be removed if either ability is removed.
#058	Boosts Sp. Atk if another Pokémon has Plus.	Raises the Special Attack of the user if any ally has [ability Plus]. The bonus does not count as a stat modifier and will be removed if either ability is removed.
#059	CASTFORM transforms with the weather.	Changes the user's type and form according to the weather if it is a Castform, except during Sandstorm.  If the weather conditions change to something that does not trigger the ability, the user will revert to normal form.  If the ability is lost or suppressed, the user will not be able to change type or form until the ability is restored. When restored, the ability activates even if the user has the correct form and type in the current weather conditions.
#060	Protects the Pokémon from item theft.	Prevents an opponent from removing a held item from the user using moves like [move Covet], [move Thief], [move "Knock Off"], [move "Bug Bite"], [move Switcheroo], unless the opponent has [ability "Mold Breaker"].  The user can still use moves that involves the loss of its own item (e.g. [move Trick], [move Fling], [move Switcheroo]).  It also makes Pokémon easier to get hooked when fishing if the user is in the lead.
#061	The Pokémon may heal its own status problems.	The user has a 30% chance of getting healed from any major status ailment after each turn, before the status activates in case the status is Burn or Poison.

#064	Inflicts damage on foes using any draining move.	The opponent loses the amount of HP it would have gained when using a leeching move on the user, including [move Absorb], [move "Mega Drain"], [move "Giga Drain"], [move "Leech Life"] and [move "Leech Seed"]. Liquid Ooze does not affect [move "Dream Eater"].

#070	The Pokémon makes it sunny if it is in battle.	Summons harsh sunlight that lasts indefinitely upon entering battle unless replaced by a different weather condition.  When multiple abilities that change weather upon entering battle activate, the last one to activate will override the weather change.
#071	Prevents the foe from fleeing.	Prevents an opponent from switching out or escaping (including via [move Teleport]).  Opponents immune to Ground-type moves are immune to the ability (e.g. Flying-type Pokémon, though [ability Levitate], [move "Magnet Rise"]). If a normally immune opponent is made vulnerable to Ground-type moves (e.g. through change of typing, suppression or change in ability, holding [item "Iron Ball"], affected by [move Gravity]), the opponent will be affected by Arena Trap. [move U-Turn], [move "Baton Pass"], still allows an opponent to switch out. Holding [item "Shed Shell"] allows an opponent to switch out, but not escape or [move Teleport]. Having [ability "Run Away"] or holding [item "Smoke Ball"] allows escaping but not switching out.  It also doubles the encounter rate of Pokémon in the overworld.
#072	Prevents the Pokémon from falling asleep.	The user cannot be inflicted with Sleep.  The user cannot use the [move Rest]. If the user acquired the ability while asleep (including regaining a lost ability through switch out), it will immediately wake up.

#073	Prevents the Pokémon's stats from being lowered.	The opponent cannot lower the user's stats by using a move that specifically lower the stats of the target.
#074	Boosts the power of physical attacks.	Doubles the attack of the user when in battle.  This stat boost is not counted as a stat modifier.
#075	The Pokémon is protected against critical hits.	Moves cannot land Critical Hits on the user.
#076	Eliminates the effects of weather.	Negates all effects of weather, but does not prevent the weather itself.
#077	Raises evasion if the Pokémon is confused.	Increases evasion of the user by 20% when confused. The boost ends when confusion ends
#078	Raises Speed if hit by an Electric-type move.	Protects the user from Electric-type moves, will not miss, will negate all effects of those moves and will raise the Speed of the user by 50% if the user is not protected from the move (e.g. by having Earth-typing).
#079	Raises Attack if the foe is of the same gender.	Increases damage inflicted by the user against opponents of the same gender by 25%, but decreases damage against the opposite gender by 25%.  The ability has no effect if either Pokémon are genderless.
#080	Raises Speed each time the Pokémon flinches.	The user's Speed is raised by 50% upon flinching.  Flinching caused when using [move "Focus Punch"] and failing to do so does not activate this ability.
#081	Raises evasion in a hailstorm.	Increases the evasion of the user by 20% during hail.  It also protects the user against hail damage if the user does not have the Ice typing.  It also lowers the encounter rate in an area by 50% with blizzard if the user is in the lead.
#082	Encourages the early use of a held Berry.	Causes the user to eat any held berry triggered by low HP when it falls to or below 50% of its HP, ignoring the usual threshold.
#083	Raises Attack upon taking a critical hit.	Raises the Attack of the user to 6 stages (4 times its original Attack) when the user is hit with a critical hit.  The ability also works if the critical hit is received by a [move Substitute].
#084	Raises Speed if a held item is used.	Doubles the speed of the user when it uses or loses its held item. If the user gains an item or leaves the battle, the boost is lost.  The bonus does not count as a stat modifier.
#085	Weakens the power of Fire-type moves.	Halves damage the user receives from Fire moves and burns.
#086	The Pokémon is prone to wild stat changes.	Doubles the user's stat modifiers. These doubled modifiers are still capped at -6 or 6 stages.  The modifiers themselves are not doubled, but their effects are doubled for the user. This means doubled modifiers will be passed as singles through [move "Baton Pass"], but single modifiers passed on to a Simple user will be doubled, copied as singles through [move "Psych Up"] and the likes, and stat modifiers can further be applied on the user at -6 or 6 stages without further changing the effective stat modifier.
#087	Reduces HP if it is hot. Water restores HP.	The user takes 12.5% of its max HP as damage each turn during strong sunlight, but heals for 12.5% of its max HP during rain. Increases damage received from Fire-type moves by 25%, but absorbs Water-type moves, healing for 25% of the user's max HP.  The ability has priority over held items and works through [move Substitute].
#088	Adjusts power according to the foe's ability.	Raises the user's attack stat corresponding to the opponents' weaker defense by 1 stage upon entering battle. In case the Defense and Special Defense stats tie, the Special Attack of the user is boosted instead.  In double battles, the sum of the opponents' Defense and Special Defense determine the boosted attack.  the ability activates when acquired and boosts from the ability are lost when the ability is lost or suppressed.
#089	Boosts the power of punching moves.	The user's punch-based moves get a 20% boost in base power.  Punch-based moves include [move "Hammer Arm"], [move "Meteor Mash"] and [move "Sky Uppercut"] besides the moves with 'Punch' in their names, but excludes [move "Sucker Punch"].
#090	Restores HP if the Pokémon is poisoned.	The user recovers 12.5% of its max HP after each turn when poisoned or badly poisoned in place of taking damage.  If the user is badly poisoned, the toxic counters still continue, meaning that if the ability is lost or suppressed, the user will take the damage normally taken after the number of turns spent under toxic.  The user still takes poison damage outside of battle.
#091	Powers up moves of the same type.	Boosts the same-type attack bonus of the user from 1.5× to 2×.
#092	Increases the frequency of multi-strike moves.	The user's moves that hit 2-5 times always hit the maximum number of times.
#093	Heals status problems if it is raining.	The user is cured of any major status ailment after each turn during rain.
#094	Boosts Sp. Atk, but lowers HP in sunshine.	Increases the user's Special Attack by 50% but the user loses 12.5% of its max HP after each turn during strong sunlight.
#095	Boosts Speed if there is a status problem.	Increases the user's Speed by 50% with when it has a major status ailment, and ignores the cut in Speed caused by Paralysis.  It also reduces the encounter rate of Pokémon in the area by 50% if the user is in the lead.
#096	All the Pokémon's moves become the Normal type.	Makes the user's moves all act Normal-type; being not very effective on Rock and Steel-types and ineffective on Ghost-types. Typeless moves remain typeless. [move "Weather Ball"] is forced to be normal type but still changes appearance and power under appropriate weather. [move "Will-O-Wisp"] for example will not activate [ability "Flash Fire"] and will not burn Fire-types since they are immune to burn.
#097	Powers up moves if they become critical hits.	The user's critical hits deal 50% more damage than usual.
#098	The Pokémon only takes damage from attacks.	The user is immune to indirect damage (status ailments, field hazards, weather, recoil); other effects like Atk cut from Burn still apply, except with Paralysis; the user cannot be immobilized. [move "Leech Seed"] and [ability "Liquid Ooze"] will damage/heal neither the user nor the opponent. An opponent will not consume their [item "Jaboca Berry"] or [item "Rowap Berry"] when hit by the user. Self-inflicted damage such as [move "Belly Drum"], [move "Pain Split"], [move Curse], [move Substitute] and [move Struggle], self knockout moves and confusion damage still apply. Turn counters on bad poison still continue despite the damage being negated.
#099	Ensures the Pokémon and its foe's attacks land.	Moves used by or against the user never miss (except OHKO moves), even if the target is using [move Dig], [move Fly], [move Bounce], [move Dive] or [move "Shadow Force"].  Doubles the chances of wild Pokémon encounter in the overworld if the user is in the lead.
#100	The Pokémon moves after even slower foes.	The user will move last within the same move priority order. If there are multiple users of Stall, their speed determines the order of their moves.  The effects of [item "Full Incense"] and [item "Lagging Tail"] have priority over the ability, meaning the holder of such items will move after the user. If the user is holding either items, the ability is ignored.  The ability still makes the user move last during [move "Trick Room"].
#101	Powers up the Pokémon's weaker moves.	The user's moves with base power of 60 or less have their base power raised by 50%, except [move Struggle], but including moves with variable base power, if they happen to meet the threshold requirement (e.g. [move Magnitude] and [move "Hidden Power"]).  Self inflicted damage due to confusion which has a base power of 40 does not get boosted.
#102	Prevents status problems in sunny weather.	The user cannot be inflicted with major status ailments during strong sunlight.  The ability does not heal those inflicted before the required conditions are in place for the ability to activate.  [move Yawn] will fail to activate. An already-used [move Yawn] will fail if the required conditions are subsequently met on the turn [move Yawn] takes effect.
#103	The Pokémon can't use any held items.	Items the user holds are completely ignored.  Items that do not affect the course of battles work (e.g. [item "Exp. Share"], [item "Amulet Coin"], [item "Soothe Bell"]).
#104	Moves can be used regardless of abilities.	The user's moves ignore the target's abilities that would otherwise hinder or prevent their current effect on the target, or their resolving moves (e.g. [move Spike]).
#105	Heightens the critical-hit ratios of moves.	The user has its moves' critical hit rates raised by one stage.
#106	Damages the foe landing the finishing hit.	Damages the attacker for 25% its max HP when the user is knocked out by a contact move.
#107	Senses the foe's dangerous moves.	Notifies all trainers upon entering battle if an opponent has a super-effective move, Self-Destruct, Explosion, or a one-hit KO move. The move itself is not revealed. [move Counter], [move "Mirror Coat"] and [move "Metal Burst"] count as attacking moves of their respective types, while [move Bide], [move "Hidden Power"], [move Judgement], [move "Natural Gift"] and [move "Weather Ball"] are considered to be Normal-type.
#108	Determines what moves the foe has.	Reveals the opponents' strongest move upon entering battle (among all opponents if there are multiple). In the event of a tie, one of the moves is chosen at random.  Moves with no specific damage are listed as having a power of: 160 for OHKO moves ([move "Sheer Cold"], [move Guillotine], [move "Horn Drill"], [move Fissure]), 120 for counter move ([move Counter], [move "Metal Burst"], [move "Mirror Coat"]), 80 for moves with variable damage ([move "Crush Grip"], [move "Dragon Rage"], [move Endeavor], [move Flail], [move Frustration], [move "Grass Knot"], [move "Gyro Ball"], [move "Hidden Power"], [move "Low Kick"], [move "Natural Gift"], [move "Night Shade"], [move Psywave], [move Return], [move Reversal], [move "Seismic Toss"], [move "Sonic Boom"], [move "Trump Card"], [move "Wring Out"]) and 0 for any other variable damage move.
#109	Ignores any change in ability by the foe.	If the user uses a damaging move or is damaged by a damaging move, the opponent's stat stages are ignored during damage and accuracy calculation.  If the user attacks, the Defense, Special Defense and Evasion stat changes of the target are ignored. If the user gets attacked, the opponent's Attack, Special Attack and Accuracy stat changes are ignored. The power of [move Punishment] is calculated normally.
#110	Powers up “not very effective” moves.	Doubles damage inflicted with not-very-effective moves.
#111	Powers down super­ effective moves.	Decreases damage received from super effective moves by 25%.
#112	Temporarily halves Attack and Speed.	Halves Attack and Speed of the user for five turns upon entering battle. If the user loses and regains the ability without leaving the field, the user's 5 turn counter continues from where it was.
#113	Enables moves to hit Ghost-type foes.	The Normal and Fighting-types moves of the user ignore the Ghost-type immunity of Ghost-type opponents.
#114	The Pokémon draws in all Water-type moves.	Redirects all single-target Water moves to this Pokémon where possible; nullifying the damage, accuracy calculations and any secondary effect; and raising the user's Special Attack by one stage.  When multiple Pokémon with the ability are present on the field, the one with the highest Speed becomes the target and in case of a tie, it is random between them the one the longest on the field takes priority.
