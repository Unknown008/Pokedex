Hello everyone!

Today I would like to suggest something that not everyone will like and some will down right hate it. Balance.
Thats right, balancing pokemon to make all fully evolved pokemon capable of holding their own in pvp. This means
some of the more stronger pokemon like dragonite and volcarona would receive a nerf while pokemon like Butterfree and Hitmontop would receive some form of enhansment which could be in the form of more moves, stats or better abilities.

Now, lets take a second to tell you now that this is not something you would be forced to do. IT could be implemented in may different ways. The way it would be added would ultimately be up to the staff, but I do have a few ideas.
1. Whole new server with only balanced pokemon. This way seems to be the best and least confusing for people. A new server  would be created that would only have balanced pokemon able to be caught / trained / battled.
2. Balance Clause. The balanced pokemon could be implemented on any server but NO ONE would be forced to play against, or use them if they do not want to do so. There would be a clause box (just like a sleep, same item, OHKO etc. clauses) that you can select or de-select before battle. There could even be a box that you can "check off" in the options of the game that would prevent any other players from challenging you to a balanced pokemon battle if you are not into that kind of thing. As for seasons go a different ladder can simply be added for the balanced meta.
3. Everyone hates this idea and it just doesn't get added. I'm sure there are other ways that I just haven't had the time myself to think them up or thoroughly think them through.

A little history on me:
I used to be apart of another pokemon mmo that was in the works but was never finished. It was going to use the balanced pokemon. I was the head balancer of said project. We not only balanced pokemon but also some aspects of the game. When we first started, gen 6 had not come out yet but we already had the idea
of making weather not lasting permanently though pokemon with weather starting abilities. We worked very hard on each individual pokemon and tested them thoroughly. We made a test server that used the Pokemon Online client to balance and test and balance more and test, over and over. We had multiple balance people working on
pokemon and we would sometimes takes 1 or more weeks to balance a single pokemon. While some pokemon were a bit easier and could be done in less then a few days. We also did our best to keep pokemon as close to what they were to begin with and made sure to never add something to a pokemon that didn't make sense. Such as
punching moves to a pokemon without hands. Even though pokemon has that already. (I'm looking at you gastly) xD


Now, pokemon is not a game that can be balanced easily. But then again, what game is. Balance is a job that is never truly done. Humans are not perfect and when  trying your best to balance a pokemon that was weak to make it a bit stronger you can accidentally make it OP through simple over sights, or a pokemon that is OP could
be made to weak. But that's okay. That's why we would having testing of the pokemon meticulously.
